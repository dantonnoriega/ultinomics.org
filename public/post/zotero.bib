  abstract = {Despite a lack of consistent diagnostic criteria, the metabolic syndrome (MetS) is increasingly evident in children and adolescents, portending a tsunami of chronic disease and mortality as this generation ages. The diagnostic criteria for MetS apply absolute cutoffs to continuous variables and fail to take into account aging, pubertal changes, and race/ethnicity. We attempt to define MetS mechanistically to determine its specific etiologies and to identify targets for therapy. Whereas the majority of studies document a relationship of visceral fat to insulin resistance, ectopic liver fat correlates better with dysfunctional insulin dynamics from which the rest of MetS derives. In contrast to the systemic metabolism of glucose, the liver is the primary metabolic clearinghouse for 4 specific foodstuffs that have been associated with the development of MetS: trans-fats, branched-chain amino acids, ethanol, and fructose. These 4 substrates (1) are not insulin regulated and (2) deliver metabolic intermediates to hepatic mitochondria without an appropriate ``pop-off'' mechanism for excess substrate, enhancing lipogenesis and ectopic adipose storage. Excessive fatty acid derivatives interfere with hepatic insulin signal transduction. Reactive oxygen species accumulate, which cannot be quenched by adjacent peroxisomes; these reactive oxygen species reach the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to a compensatory process termed the ``unfolded protein response,'' driving further insulin resistance and eventually insulin deficiency. No obvious drug target exists in this pathway; thus, the only rational therapeutic approaches remain (1) altering hepatic substrate availability (dietary modification), (2) reducing hepatic substrate flux (high fiber), or (3) increasing mitochondrial efficiency (exercise).},

  abstract = {Context~Modifiable behavioral risk factors are leading causes of mortality in the United States. Quantifying these will provide insight into the effects
of recent trends and the implications of missed prevention opportunities.Objectives~To identify and quantify the leading causes of mortality in the United
States.Design~Comprehensive MEDLINE search of English-language articles that identified
epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory studies linking risk behaviors and
mortality. The search was initially restricted to articles published during
or after 1990, but we later included relevant articles published in 1980 to
December 31, 2002. Prevalence and relative risk were identified during the
literature search. We used 2000 mortality data reported to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention to identify the causes and number of deaths.
The estimates of cause of death were computed by multiplying estimates of
the cause-attributable fraction of preventable deaths with the total mortality
data.Main Outcome Measures~Actual causes of death.Results~The leading causes of death in 2000 were tobacco (435~000 deaths;
18.1\% of total US deaths), poor diet and physical inactivity (400~000
deaths; 16.6\%), and alcohol consumption (85~000 deaths; 3.5\%). Other
actual causes of death were microbial agents (75~000), toxic agents (55~000),
motor vehicle crashes (43~000), incidents involving firearms (29~000),
sexual behaviors (20~000), and illicit use of drugs (17~000).Conclusions~These analyses show that smoking remains the leading cause of mortality.
However, poor diet and physical inactivity may soon overtake tobacco as the
leading cause of death. These findings, along with escalating health care
costs and aging population, argue persuasively that the need to establish
a more preventive orientation in the US health care and public health systems
has become more urgent.},

  abstract = {Summary
Evidence suggests that excessive intake of added sugars has adverse effects on cardiometabolic health, which is consistent with many reviews and consensus reports from WHO and other unbiased sources. 74\% of products in the US food supply contain caloric or low-calorie sweeteners, or both. Of all packaged foods and beverages purchased by a nationally representative sample of US households in 2013, 68\% (by proportion of calories) contain caloric sweeteners and 2\% contain low-calorie sweeteners. We believe that in the absence of intervention, the rest of the world will move towards this pervasiveness of added sugars in the food supply. Our analysis of trends in sales of sugar-sweetened beverages around the world, in terms of calories sold per person per day and volume sold per person per day, shows that the four regions with the highest consumption are North America, Latin America, Australasia, and western Europe. The fastest absolute growth in sales of sugar-sweetened beverages by country in 2009\textendash{}14 was seen in Chile. We believe that action is needed to tackle the high levels and continuing growth in sales of such beverages worldwide. Many governments have initiated actions to reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages in the past few years, including taxation (eg, in Mexico); reduction of their availability in schools; restrictions on marketing of sugary foods to children; public awareness campaigns; and positive and negative front-of-pack labelling. In our opinion, evidence of the effectiveness of these actions shows that they are moving in the right direction, but governments should view them as a learning process and improve their design over time. A key challenge for policy makers and researchers is the absence of a consensus on the relation of beverages containing low-calorie sweeteners and fruit juices with cardiometabolic outcomes, since decisions about whether these are healthy substitutes for sugar-sweetened beverages are an integral part of policy design.},

  doi = {10.1136/tc.2008.025338},
  abstract = {Background: Tobacco industry funding was instrumental in creating and financing the Consumer Tax Alliance in 1989 as an organisation that relied upon extensive media outreach to build opposition to excise taxes as a regressive form of taxation. By obscuring its own role in this effort, the tobacco industry undermined the public's reasonable expectations for transparency in the policy-making process.
Aim: To examine the formation and activities of the Consumer Tax Alliance as a ``hybrid'' form of interest group in order to provide tobacco control and public health advocates with a better understanding of unanticipated tobacco industry coalitions and facilitate appropriate countermeasures.
Methods: Document searches through the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library and through Tobacco Documents Online and review of background literature.
Results: The Tobacco Institute actively sought liberal allies beginning in the mid-1980s in seeking to build public opposition to cigarette excise tax increases by promoting them as a regressive form of taxation. The creation of the Consumer Tax Alliance in 1989 was expressly intended to turn labour and middle-class opinion against prospective excise tax increases in federal budget deficit negotiations, without divulging the tobacco industry's role in its formation.
Conclusion: It is important to understand the dynamic by which trusted organisations can be induced to alter their agendas in response to funding sources. Advocates need to understand this form of interest group behaviour so that they are better able to negotiate the policy arena by diagnosing and exposing this influence where it occurs and, by doing so, be better prepared to take appropriate countermeasures.},

This paper discusses the limitations of two approaches widely used in corporate finance and asset pricing research: demeaning the dependent variable with respect to the group (e.g., ``industry-adjusting'') and adding the mean of the group's dependent variable as a control. We show that these methods produce inconsistent estimates and can distort inference. In contrast, the fixed effects estimator is consistent and should be used instead. We also explain how to estimate the fixed effects model when traditional methods are computationally infeasible.Additional programming advice can be found on our websites.},

  doi = {10.3945/ajcn.113.069443},
  abstract = {Background: Although the intake of high-fat and high-sugar food activates mesolimbic reward, gustatory, and oral somatosensory brain regions, contributing to overeating, few studies have examined the relative role of fat and sugar in the activation of these brain regions, which would inform policy, prevention, and treatment interventions designed to reduce obesity.
Objective: We evaluated the effect of a high-fat or high-sugar equicaloric chocolate milkshake and increasing fat or sugar milkshake content on the activation of these regions.
Design: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess the neural response to the intake of high-fat/high-sugar, high-fat/low-sugar, low-fat/high-sugar, and low-fat/low-sugar chocolate milkshakes and a tasteless solution in 106 lean adolescents (mean $\pm$ SD age = 15.00 $\pm$ 0.88 y). Analyses contrasted the activation to the various milkshakes.
Results: High-fat compared with high-sugar equicaloric milkshakes caused greater activation in the bilateral caudate, postcentral gyrus, hippocampus, and inferior frontal gyrus. High-sugar compared with high-fat equicaloric milkshakes caused greater activation in the bilateral insula extending into the putamen, the Rolandic operculum, and thalamus, which produced large activation regions. Increasing sugar in low-fat milkshakes caused greater activation in the bilateral insula and Rolandic operculum; increasing fat content did not elicit greater activation in any region.
Conclusions: Fat caused greater activation of the caudate and oral somatosensory regions than did sugar, sugar caused greater activation in the putamen and gustatory regions than did fat, increasing sugar caused greater activity in gustatory regions, and increasing fat did not affect the activation. Results imply that sugar more effectively recruits reward and gustatory regions, suggesting that policy, prevention, and treatment interventions should prioritize reductions in sugar intake.

  abstract = {Context
American obesity rates continue to escalate, but an effective policy response remains elusive. Specific changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) have been proposed as one way to improve nutrition and combat obesity among lower-income populations. While current SNAP proposals hold promise, some important challenges still remain.

Methods
We discuss the four most common recommendations for changes to SNAP and their benefits and limitations. We then propose three new delivery options for SNAP that take advantage of behavioral economic insights and encourage the selection of healthy foods.

Findings
Although the existing proposals could help SNAP recipients, they often do not address some important behavioral impediments to buying healthy foods. We believe that behavioral economics can be used to design alternative policies with several advantages, although we recognize and discuss some of their limitations. The first proposal rewards healthy purchases with more SNAP funds and provides an additional incentive to maintain healthier shopping patterns. The second proposal uses the opportunity to win prizes to reward healthy food choices, and the prizes further support healthier habits. The final proposal simplifies healthy food purchases by allowing individuals to commit their SNAP benefits to more nutritious selections in advance.

Conclusions
Reforming the delivery structure of SNAP's benefits could help improve nutrition, weight, and overall health of lower-income individuals. We advocate for more and diverse SNAP proposals, which should be tested and, possibly, combined. Their implementation, however, would require political will, administrative capacity, and funding.},

A significant body of research has emerged suggesting that participation in SNAP increases the probability of being obese for adult women and has little effect on the probability for adult men. However, studies addressing the effects of participation on children have produced mixed results. This paper examines the effect of long-term SNAP participation on the Body Mass Index (BMI) percentile and probability of being overweight or obese for children ages 5\textendash{}18 using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Children and Young Adults data set. An instrumental variables identification strategy that exploits exogenous variation in state-level program parameters, as well as state and federal expansions of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), is used to address the endogeneity between SNAP participation and obesity. SNAP participation is found to significantly reduce BMI percentile and the probability of being overweight or obese for boys and girls ages 5\textendash{}11 and boys ages 12\textendash{}18. For girls ages 12\textendash{}18, SNAP participation appears to have no significant effect on these outcomes. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare the response by overweight individuals, counselled in a work environment, to energy-reduced diets in which the amount of sucrose-containing foods is varied.
DESIGN: Two energy-reduced diets were designed as a weight-reducing programme. A low-sugar diet (LSD) providing 5\% of its energy from sucrose and a sugar-containing diet (SCD) providing 10\% of its energy from sucrose incorporated as sweet foods were devised. Both diets were constructed to contain about 33\% of the energy from fat. The diets, designed to provide a deficit of 2.51 MJ/day (600 kcal/day) per individual, were randomly allocated to subjects in an 8 week parallel design study.
SUBJECTS: Ninety-five subjects were recruited from a large service industry if they were more than 7 kg (1 stone) in weight above body mass index (BMI) 25 kg/m(2). Sixty-eight subjects completed the programme.
MEASUREMENTS: Fortnightly body weight measurements were taken using calibrated scales; BMI at baseline and week 8; and nutrient intake using 2 day food record diaries at baseline and weeks 2, 4 and 8.
RESULTS: Weight loss over the 8 weeks was 2.2 kg (LSD) and 3.0 kg (SCD). BMI changed from 29.2 on the LSD and 30.1 kg/m(2) SCD at baseline to 28.2 and 28.8 kg/m(2) at week 8 respectively. The actual prescribed commercially added sucrose intakes were 5\% energy (LSD) or 10\% energy (SCD). Reported percentage energy from fat was significantly lower on the SCD (and would seem to support the theory of an inverse relationship between fat and sugar) than on the LSD, where there was seen to be no significant reduction. There was no evidence of micronutrient dilution that could be directly attributed to the sucrose content of the diets.
CONCLUSION: These results provide no justification for the exclusion of added sucrose in weight-reducing diets.},

We first estimate demand models which do not restrict unduly the pattern of consumer preferences as does much previous research in the area of differenciated products. Using recently available transactions data we estimate own and cross price elasticities in a relatively unrestricted manner. We next turn to competitive analysis using our estimated demand system. We consider two applications in this paper. The main economic factor that we consider is that the firms which produce the differentiated products almost always tend to be multi-product firms in the given industry. Our first application is competitive analysis when two firms are allowed to merge. The other application that we consider is inference on the competitive structure in an industry. In both applications we consider the effect of a multi-product firm where its competitive decisions for one brand affects it sales and prices for other brands that it produces. /// La diff{\'e}renciation des produits est un aspect {\'e}conomique central de la concurrence sur les march{\'e}s des biens de consommations comme les c{\'e}r{\'e}ales, les sodas ou les bi{\`e}res.

  abstract = {Background~
In light of the current obesity epidemic, treatment models are needed that can prevent weight gain or provide weight loss. We examined the long-term effects of a supervised program of moderate-intensity exercise on body weight and composition in previously sedentary, overweight and moderately obese men and women. We hypothesized that a 16-month program of verified exercise would prevent weight gain or provide weight loss in the exercise group compared with controls.Methods
This was a randomized controlled efficacy trial. Participants were recruited from 2 midwestern universities and their surrounding communities. One hundred thirty-one participants were randomized to exercise or control groups, and 74 completed the intervention and all laboratory testing. Exercise was supervised, and the level of energy expenditure of exercise was measured. Controls remained sedentary. All participants maintained ad libitum diets.Results
Exercise prevented weight gain in women and produced weight loss in men. Men in the exercise group had significant mean $\pm$ SD decreases in weight (5.2 $\pm$ 4.7 kg), body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) (1.6 $\pm$ 1.4), and fat mass (4.9 $\pm$ 4.4 kg) compared with controls. Women in the exercise group maintained baseline weight, body mass index, and fat mass, and controls showed significant mean $\pm$ SD increases in body mass index (1.1 $\pm$ 2.0), weight (2.9 $\pm$ 5.5 kg), and fat mass (2.1 $\pm$ 4.8 kg) at 16 months. No significant changes occurred in fat-free mass in either men or women; however, both had significantly reduced visceral fat.Conclusions
Moderate-intensity exercise sustained for 16 months is effective for weight management in young adults.},

Our main findings are that the tax would result in a decrease in store-bought energy of 24.3 kcal per day per person, which would translate into an average weight loss of 1.6 pounds during the first year and a cumulated weight loss of 2.9 pounds in the long run. We do not find evidence of substitution to sugary foods and show that complementary foods could contribute to decreasing energy purchases. Despite their significantly lower price elasticity, the tax has a similar effect on calories for the largest purchasers of SSBs.},

This article provides one example of how concepts taken from complex systems theory can be applied to real-world problems facing nurses today. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

We propose a general model that can be estimated either by quasi-maximum likelihood (in the case of exogenous regressors) or generalized method of moments (GMM) if the covariates are endogenous. The specification proposed in the paper nests several demand functions in the literature and the results can be applied to the recently proposed Exact Affine Stone Index (EASI) demand system of [Lewbel, A., Pendakur, K., 2008.

A possible solution for the econometric problem (lack of necessary degrees of freedom) is the separability concept and the closely related notion of two-stage budgeting. In this paper, weak separability is applied on the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS), its quadratic extension QUAIDS and the Rotterdam model. These two-stage budgeting demand systems were estimated on Belgian time series data and were evaluated by means of a comparison of their elasticities (both partial and total), goodness-of-fit measures and their forecasting accuracy. Though the rank three QUAIDS model does not dominate the others in every respect (at least for time series data), it has nice theoretical properties which can on their own be a justification for the use of the system.},

  abstract = {The debate about behavioral economics \textendash{} the incorporation of insights from psychology into economics \textendash{} is often framed as a question about the foundational assumptions of economic models. This paper presents a more pragmatic perspective on behavioral economics that focuses on its value for improving empirical predictions and policy decisions. I discuss three ways in which behavioral economics can contribute to public policy: by offering new policy tools, improving predictions about the effects of existing policies, and generating new welfare implications. I illustrate these contributions using applications to retirement savings, labor supply, and neighborhood choice. Behavioral models provide new tools to change behaviors such as savings rates and new counterfactuals to estimate the effects of policies such as income taxation. Behavioral models also provide new prescriptions for optimal policy that can be characterized in a non-paternalistic manner using methods analogous to those in neoclassical models. Model uncertainty does not justify using the neoclassical model; instead, it can provide a new rationale for using behavioral nudges. I conclude that incorporating behavioral features to the extent they help answer core economic questions may be more productive than viewing behavioral economics as a separate subfield that challenges the assumptions of neoclassical models.},

Using pooled cross section-time series data on state and Federal alcohol taxes and beverage prices, beer taxes are found to be poor predictors of alcohol prices. Controlling for state and period effects, excise taxes appear to be over-shifted: Retail prices rise by more than the amount of the tax, and the rise occurs within 3 months.},

Evidence shows that SNAP benefits help alleviate poverty and food insecurity among participating households. However, like most Americans, the dietary patterns of participating households show room for improvement, with adult participants typically underconsuming fruits, whole grains, and other healthy foods while consuming too many empty calories. Findings from behavioral economics pilot studies suggest that the manner in which food choices are presented can influence consumers' decisions. These insights may help design more effective strategies to encourage SNAP shoppers to make more healthful food choices. SNAP participants are less likely to have heard of the Dietary Guidelines, the Food Pyramid, or MyPyramid (now represented by MyPlate) than higher income individuals.},

To improve, health care systems need mechanisms and incentives for continually gathering, assessing, and acting on data. This requires (1) more comprehensive data, (2) converting data into information, and (3) incentives to apply that information. Restructured economic incentives can encourage clinicians to increase value (higher quality and/or lower cost) for their patients. While necessary, incentives are not sufficient\textemdash{}information is also needed. Incentives can lead clinicians to demand better information. Much of the necessary data is already used in patient care and billing; some additional variables will come directly from patients. The notion builds on two concepts: collective intelligence and positive deviance. The former characterizes knowledge gained from observing the behavior of many independent actors adapting to changing situations. Positive deviants are those who achieve far better results than expected. By rewarding positive deviants, rather than trying to identify and ``correct'' those who are problematic, providers will voluntarily identify themselves and their methods for achieving superior outcomes.},

While it is well known these estimators share an asymptotic distribution, the GEL estimators may perform better in finite sample, particularly in the case of many weak instruments. A relatively new literature has documented that finite-sample bias in the demand estimation problem of Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) is often large, especially in the absence of exogenous cost shifting instruments. This paper provides a formulation for a computationally tractable GEL estimator based on the MPEC method of Su and Judd (2012) and adapts it to the BLP problem. When compared to GMM, the GEL estimator performs substantially better, reducing the bias by as much as 90\%. Furthermore, it is possible to use analytic bias correction to reduce the bias even more and obtain accurate estimates with relatively small numbers of markets.},

  abstract = {We measure the causal effects of income and wealth on the demand for private-label products. Prior research suggests that these effects are large and, in particular, that private-label demand rises during recessions. Our empirical analysis is based on a comprehensive household-level transactions database matched with price information from store-level scanner data and wealth data based on local house value indices. The Great Recession provides a key source of the variation in our data, with a large and geographically diverse impact on household incomes over time. We estimate income and wealth effects using "within" variation of income and wealth at the household level. Our estimates can be interpreted as income and wealth effects consistent with a consumer demand model based on utility maximization. We establish a precisely measured negative effect of income on private-label shares. The effect of wealth is negative but not precisely measured. However, the estimated effect sizes are small, in contrast with prior academic work and industry views. An examination of the possible supply-side response to the recession shows only small changes in the relative price of national-brand and private-label products. Our estimates also reveal a large positive trend in private-label shares that predates the Great Recession. We examine some possible factors underlying this trend, but find no evidence that this trend is systematically related to specific private-label quality tiers or to the overall rate of private-label versus national-brand product introductions.},

Of course, in practice, the process by which policies are adopted does not resemble the planner's problem in social choice theory. In addition, real fiscal policies do not look much like the recommendations that arise from the optimal tax literature. Governments operate in public choice environments that are not conducive to focused remedying of market failure, and they suffer from their own tendencies to fail to achieve their objectives. Nevertheless, many of the tools are in place to help the federal and state governments focus tax and spending in ways that can maximize public value.},

  abstract = {Previous research on meat demand has generally used highly aggregated data (across time, products and consumers). However, meat products across species are likely stronger substitutes than some products from the same species. Further, demand for specific meat products would be expected to respond differently to market information about food safety or other events. This study uses monthly consumer panel data collected between 1992 and 2000 to estimate a disaggregated meat product demand system. The use of the expectations maximization algorithm is introduced to estimate a demand system that adjusts for the econometric problem of censored data resulting from purchased shares of some products by individuals often being equal to zero. Results indicate that certain individual meat products have noticeably different own-price elasticities than existing aggregate meat product estimates of their respective species. Some individual meat products have stronger substitutes across species than within species (e.g., beef steak and pork chops are substitutes, but beef roast and ground beef or not substitutes for steak).},

  abstract = {There is wide interest among sociologists in the study of change but little reflection of this interest in sociological research methods. In this paper we consider the advantages of and procedures of dynamic analysis of event-history data-data givin the number, timing, and sequence of changes in a categorical dependent variable. We argue for grounding this analysis in a continuous-time stochastic model. This permits the data to be fully utilized; it also allows a unified treatment of the various outcomes analyzed in the many approaches that use only part of the information contained in such data. We focus on the familiar continuos-time Markov model, summarize its properties, report its implications for various outcomes, describe extensions to deal with population heterogeneity and time dependence, and outline a maximum-likelihood procedure for estimating the extended model from event-history data. The discussion in illustrated with an empirical analysis of the effects of an income-maintenance experiment on change in marital status. We conclude by contrasting event-history analysis with cross-sectional analysis, event-count analysis, and panel analysis. We find that event-history analysis has substantial advantages over the other approaches.},

  abstract = {We are interested in estimating the average effect of a binary treatment on a scalar outcome. If assignment to the treatment is exogenous or unconfounded, that is, independent of the potential outcomes given covariates, biases associated with simple treatment-control average comparisons can be removed by adjusting for differences in the covariates. Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) show that adjusting solely for differences between treated and control units in the propensity score removes all biases associated with differences in covariates. Although adjusting for differences in the propensity score removes all the bias, this can come at the expense of efficiency, as shown by Hahn (1998), Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd (1998), and Robins, Mark, and Newey (1992). We show that weighting by the inverse of a nonparametric estimate of the propensity score, rather than the true propensity score, leads to an efficient estimate of the average treatment effect. We provide intuition for this result by showing that this estimator can be interpreted as an empirical likelihood estimator that efficiently incorporates the information about the propensity score.},

This goal can often be achieved by choosing well-matched samples of the original treated and control groups, thereby reducing bias due to the covariates. Since the 1970's, work on matching methods has examined how to best choose treated and control subjects for comparison. Matching methods are gaining popularity in fields such as economics, epidemiology, medicine, and political science. However, until now the literature and related advice has been scattered across disciplines. Researchers who are interested in using matching methods\textendash{}or developing methods related to matching\textendash{}do not have a single place to turn to learn about past and current research. This paper provides a structure for thinking about matching methods and guidance on their use, coalescing the existing research (both old and new) and providing a summary of where the literature on matching methods is now and where it should be headed.},

To answer this question, this study was conducted to provide an empirical analysis of grocery store access and prices across inner city and suburban communities within the Minneapolis and St. Paul metropolitan area. The comparison among different types of grocers and geographic areas is drawn from a survey of approximately fifty grocery items for fifty-five stores. Results indicate that the poor pay only slightly more in the Twin Cities grocery market. More significantly, those who shop in non-chain stores pay a significant premium, and the poor have less access to chain stores. This study reveals that the biggest factor contributing to higher grocery costs in poor neighborhoods is that large chain stores, where prices tend to be lower, are not located in these neighborhoods.},

Obesity alone has enormous costs and claims thousands of lives every year. Although diet quality in the European Union has improved across countries, it still falls well short of conformity with the World Health Organization dietary guidelines. In this review, we classify types of policy interventions addressing healthy eating and identify through a literature review what specific policy interventions are better suited to improve diets. Policy interventions are classified into two broad categories: information measures and measures targeting the market environment. Using this classification, we summarize a number of previous systematic reviews, academic papers, and institutional reports and draw some conclusions about their effectiveness. Of the information measures, policy interventions aimed at reducing or banning unhealthy food advertisements generally have had a weak positive effect on improving diets, while public information campaigns have been successful in raising awareness of unhealthy eating but have failed to translate the message into action. Nutritional labeling allows for informed choice. However, informed choice is not necessarily healthier; knowing or being able to read and interpret nutritional labeling on food purchased does not necessarily result in consumption of healthier foods. Interventions targeting the market environment, such as fiscal measures and nutrient, food, and diet standards, are rarer and generally more effective, though more intrusive. Overall, we conclude that measures to support informed choice have a mixed and limited record of success. On the other hand, measures to target the market environment are more intrusive but may be more effective.},

Soft drink consumption has also expanded rapidly, so much so that soft drinks are currently the largest single contributors to energy intake.

Our results, based on state soft drink sales and excise tax information between 1989 and 2006 and the National Health Examination and Nutrition Survey, suggest that soft drink taxation, as currently practiced in the United States, leads to a moderate reduction in soft drink consumption by children and adolescents. However, we show that this reduction in soda consumption is completely offset by increases in consumption of other high-calorie drinks.},

In the first step, the unknown coefficients of the "selection" equation are consistently estimated. The estimates are then used to estimate the regression equation of interest. The estimator proposed in this paper is consistent and asymptotically normal, with a rate of convergence that can be made arbitrarily close to n\textsuperscript{-1/2}, depending on the strength of certain smoothness assumptions.

Tax incidences basic lesson that the real and nominal tax burdens are not necessarily related means that taxes on capital are born by workers, that investment incentives are injurious to capitalists, that taxation of foreigners simply represent indirect domestic taxation, and that generations alive many decades in the future may be supporting those currently alive. The study of tax incidence is both fun, because it offers such surprising findings, and very important, because of its implications about the impacts of government policies. Much of the current tax incidence literature considers the settings of certainty, perfect information, and market clearing. As more sophisticated models relax these assumptions, the theory of tax incidence is enriched and, with all probability, provides even more surprising and exciting economic insights.},

Medline and Web of Science searches were conducted to identify published studies from 1992 to present that report indirect costs by obesity status; 31 studies were included. The indirect costs were grouped into six categories: costs associated with absenteeism, disability, premature mortality, presenteeism, workers' compensation, and total indirect costs. Compared with non-obese workers, obese workers miss more workdays due to illness, injury, or disability. Costs of premature mortality vary substantially across countries. The results for presenteeism and workers' compensation were mixed. More research is needed to determine obesity's causal role in increasing indirect costs, especially for workers' compensation and presenteeism. Cohort and longitudinal study designs should be a priority.},

Using novel data from New York surveys that asked directly about cigarette prices and purchases from reservations, we focus on two under-studied but basic empirical economic questions this raises. First, what is the economic incidence of the tax break? In data from New York over a period when the state did not attempt to collect taxes on reservation purchases, our estimates suggest that the tax break is usually fully shifted to the consumer. The notable exception is on one reservation where a tribal monopoly captures almost half of the tax break. Second, has the tax break increased consumer demand for low-quality cigarettes relative to high-quality cigarettes? New York's cigarette tax is a fixed amount per pack, providing an opportunity to test the Alchian and Allen substitution theorem. We find some support for the prediction that the tax break increases consumer demand for lower-quality cigarettes.},

The large obesity-related health burden negatively impacts many relevant health outcomes (e.g. quality of life, disability, mortality) and leads to increased healthcare utilization. This excess service use is the main driver behind high healthcare costs of obese individuals. Findings indicate that costs rise curvilinearly with increasing body mass index, especially among the obese. As more individuals of a country's population become obese, a larger share of total annual national healthcare expenditure is spent on obesity and obesity-related health problems. In addition to escalating healthcare costs, obesity goes along with indirect costs through decreases in workforce productivity. The empirical evidence has shown beyond doubt that obesity negatively impacts individuals, healthcare systems, employers, and the economy as a whole. This article provides a brief overview of selected economic consequences associated with excess-weight.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.pmcj.2015.10.003},
  abstract = {Public transport, especially the bus transport, can reduce the private car usage and fuel consumption, and alleviate traffic congestion. However, when traveling in buses, the travelers not only care about the waiting time, but also care about the crowdedness in the bus itself. Excessively overcrowded bus may drive away the anxious travelers and make them reluctant to take buses. So accurate, real-time and reliable passenger demand prediction becomes necessary, which can help determine the bus headway and help reduce the waiting time of passengers. Based on a large database from a real bus system, this paper aims to present a passenger demand prediction system for mobile users. The system includes a server-side bus information data stream processing and mining program and a client-side mobile application for Android smartphones. The server program continuously monitors for each bus stop the number of passengers waiting at the bus stop, the number of passengers that will pass the bus stop, as well as the traffic conditions in the area around the stop. It delivers real time bus and traffic information to mobile users via restful web services. The client-side location-based mobile application consumes these services to help mobile users make informed transportation choices. For example the availability of buses might be a deterrent when they are too crowded. However, there are three major challenges for predicting the passenger demands on bus services: inhomogeneous, seasonal bursty periods and periodicities. To overcome the challenges, we propose three predictive models and further take a data stream ensemble framework to predict the number of passengers. We develop a prototype system with different types of Android based mobile phones and comprehensively experiment over a 22-week period. The evaluation results suggest that the proposed system achieves outstanding prediction accuracy among 86,411 passenger demands on bus services, more than 78\% of them are accurately forecasted.},

We recruit over 200 participants and track their purchases for a period of 6 months, permitting us a glimpse of more than 3,500 individual shopping trips. We randomize participants to one of several treatments, in which we incentivize fresh fruit and vegetable purchases, provide tips for fruit and vegetable preparation, or both. We report several key insights. First, our informational content treatment has little effect. Second, we find an important price effect: modest pecuniary incentives more than double the proportion of dollars spent on produce in the grocery store. Third, we find an interesting pattern of consumption after the experiment ends: even when incentives are removed, the treatment group has higher fruit and vegetable purchases compared to the control group. These long-term results are in stark contrast to either a standard price model or a behavioral model of 'crowd out.' Rather, our results are consonant with a habit formation model. This opens up the distinct possibility that short term incentives can be used as a key instrument to combat obesity.},

  abstract = {Background
Family planning programmes in developing countries need a better understanding of nurse\textendash{}patient communication in order to improve the quality of counselling.
Objectives
To identify factors in the clinic and in the community that enable nurses and patients to communicate effectively with one another.
Design
The study explored the personal experiences of nurses and patients who communicate especially effectively during family planning consultations (so-called ``positive deviants'').
Setting
Sixty-four randomly selected public clinics located in East Java, Indonesia.
Participants
Seven positive deviant nurses and 32 positive deviant patients were identified from among 64 nurses and 768 patients who participated in an earlier patient coaching study. Flooding prevented 5 patients from participating in the study, reducing their number to 27.
Methods
Investigators conducted: (1) a content analysis of qualitative data collected by structured in-depth interviews and focus-group discussions (FGDs) with positive deviant nurses and patients, and (2) analyses of variance (ANOVA) of quantitative data on clinic, nurse, and patient characteristics.
Results
Positive deviant nurses identified four factors, listed in rough order of importance, that helped them communicate effectively: independent study to strengthen their knowledge and skills; communication aids; feedback from colleagues; and motivation stemming from a desire to help people, patients' appreciation, husband's support, and increased income. Positive deviant patients identified five enabling factors: motivation due to their need for a service; confidence in their own communication skills; positive feedback from nurses; belief in patients' right and responsibility to communicate with nurses; and communication aids.
Conclusions
Insights from positive deviant nurses and patients suggest that efforts to improve nurse\textendash{}patient communication should go beyond conventional communication skills training. Managers should consider a mix of clinic-based interventions (such as peer feedback, communication aids, and better management of patient flow) and community-based interventions (such as patient education and mass media).},

  abstract = {The literature assessing the efficacy of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as the Food Stamp Program, has long puzzled over positive associations between SNAP receipt and various undesirable health outcomes such as food insecurity. Assessing the causal impacts of SNAP, however, is hampered by two key identification problems: endogenous selection into participation and extensive systematic underreporting of participation status. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we extend partial identification bounding methods to account for these two identification problems in a single unifying framework. Specifically, we derive informative bounds on the average treatment effect (ATE) of SNAP on child food insecurity, poor general health, obesity, and anemia across a range of different assumptions used to address the selection and classification error problems. In particular, to address the selection problem, we apply relatively weak nonparametric assumptions on the latent outcomes, selected treatments, and observed covariates. To address the classification error problem, we formalize a new approach that uses auxiliary administrative data on the size of the SNAP caseload to restrict the magnitudes and patterns of SNAP reporting errors. Layering successively stronger assumptions, an objective of our analysis is to make transparent how the strength of the conclusions varies with the strength of the identifying assumptions. Under the weakest restrictions, there is substantial ambiguity; we cannot rule out the possibility that SNAP increases or decreases poor health. Under stronger but plausible assumptions used to address the selection and classification error problems, we find that commonly cited relationships between SNAP and poor health outcomes provide a misleading picture about the true impacts of the program. Our tightest bounds identify favorable impacts of SNAP on child health.},

  abstract = {Background In the context of food, convenience is generally associated with less healthy foods. Given the reality of present-biased preferences, if convenience was associated with healthier foods and less healthy foods were less convenient, people would likely consume healthier foods. This study examines the application of this principle in a school lunchroom where healthier foods were made more convenient relative to less healthy foods.
Methods One of two lunch lines in a cafeteria was arranged so as to display only healthier foods and flavored milk. Trained field researchers collected purchase and consumption data before and after the conversion. Mean comparisons were used to identify differences in selection and consumption of healthier foods, less healthy foods and chocolate milk.
Results Sales of healthier foods increased by 18\% and grams of less healthy foods consumed decreased by nearly 28\%. Also, healthier foods' share of total consumption increased from 33 to 36\%. Lastly, we find that students increased their consumption of flavored milk, but flavored milk's share of total consumption did not increase.
Conclusions In a school lunchroom, a convenience line that offered only healthier food options nudged students to consume fewer unhealthy foods. This result has key implications for encouraging healthy behavior in public schools nation wide, cafeterias and other food establishments.},

Because obesity has been equated with addiction, and because of their evolutionary commonalities, we chose to examine the metabolic, hedonic, and societal similarities between fructose and its fermentation byproduct ethanol. Elucidation of fructose metabolism in liver and fructose action in brain demonstrate three parallelisms with ethanol. First, hepatic fructose metabolism is similar to ethanol, as they both serve as substrates for de novo lipogenesis, and in the process both promote hepatic insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hepatic steatosis. Second, fructosylation of proteins with resultant superoxide formation can result in hepatic inflammation similar to acetaldehyde, an intermediary metabolite of ethanol. Lastly, by stimulating the ``hedonic pathway'' of the brain both directly and indirectly, fructose creates habituation, and possibly dependence; also paralleling ethanol. Thus, fructose induces alterations in both hepatic metabolism and central nervous system energy signaling, leading to a ``vicious cycle'' of excessive consumption and disease consistent with metabolic syndrome. On a societal level, the treatment of fructose as a commodity exhibits market similarities to ethanol. Analogous to ethanol, societal efforts to reduce fructose consumption will likely be necessary to combat the obesity epidemic.},

  title = {Weight Change in Relation to Intake of Sugar and Sweet Foods before and after Weight Reducing Gastric Surgery},
  volume = {20},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that a diet containing many sweet foods is associated with poor weight loss after gastroplasty.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 375 severely obese subjects followed for 2 y after vertical banded gastroplasty or gastric banding; 34 subjects followed after gastric bypass.
RESULTS: Total energy and all macronutrients were reduced 2 y after surgery. Sweet foods were less reduced than other foods, resulting in a relative increase of sugar intake. At 2 y a high relative intake of sugar and fat was associated with a low energy intake and a large weight reduction in the gastroplasty group. In the highest quartile of mono+disaccharide intake ($>$ 142 g) weight loss was 29.9 kg compared to 25.1 kg in lowest quartile ($>$ 72 g). Absolute and relative sugar intake before surgery did not predict weight outcome. At 6 months, i.e. during a period of active weight reduction, energy intake was significantly related to weight loss.
CONCLUSION: Gastroplasty patients who continue selecting sweet foods appear to maintain lower energy intakes and lose more weight. However the associations are unlikely to be causal but probably indicative of changes in other aspects of the diet, eg exclusion of regular meals. Since large weight losses are most likely to be associated with low quality diets these results highlight the need for supplementation therapy of gastroplasty patients. Finally the lack of association between presurgical sugar intake and subsequent weight loss brings into question the surgical practice of selectively assigning sweet eaters to gastric bypass.},

Our primary goal is to present a framework which enables one to obtain estimates of demand and cost parameters for a class of oligopolistic differentiated products markets. These estimates can be obtained using only widely available product-level and aggregate consumer-level data, and they are consistent with a structural model of equilibrium in an oligopolistic industry. When we apply the techniques developed here to the U.S. automobile market, we obtain cost and demand parameters for (essentially) all models marketed over a twenty year period.},

  doi = {10.2337/dc12-2625},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVE This study updates previous estimates of the economic burden of diagnosed diabetes and quantifies the increased health resource use and lost productivity associated with diabetes in 2012.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The study uses a prevalence-based approach that combines the demographics of the U.S. population in 2012 with diabetes prevalence, epidemiological data, health care cost, and economic data into a Cost of Diabetes Model. Health resource use and associated medical costs are analyzed by age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance coverage, medical condition, and health service category. Data sources include national surveys, Medicare standard analytical files, and one of the largest claims databases for the commercially insured population in the U.S.
RESULTS The total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes in 2012 is \$245 billion, including \$176 billion in direct medical costs and \$69 billion in reduced productivity. The largest components of medical expenditures are hospital inpatient care (43\% of the total medical cost), prescription medications to treat the complications of diabetes (18\%), antidiabetic agents and diabetes supplies (12\%), physician office visits (9\%), and nursing/residential facility stays (8\%). People with diagnosed diabetes incur average medical expenditures of about \$13,700 per year, of which about \$7,900 is attributed to diabetes. People with diagnosed diabetes, on average, have medical expenditures approximately 2.3 times higher than what expenditures would be in the absence of diabetes. For the cost categories analyzed, care for people with diagnosed diabetes accounts for more than 1 in 5 health care dollars in the U.S., and more than half of that expenditure is directly attributable to diabetes. Indirect costs include increased absenteeism (\$5 billion) and reduced productivity while at work (\$20.8 billion) for the employed population, reduced productivity for those not in the labor force (\$2.7 billion), inability to work as a result of disease-related disability (\$21.6 billion), and lost productive capacity due to early mortality (\$18.5 billion).
CONCLUSIONS The estimated total economic cost of diagnosed diabetes in 2012 is \$245 billion, a 41\% increase from our previous estimate of \$174 billion (in 2007 dollars). This estimate highlights the substantial burden that diabetes imposes on society. Additional components of societal burden omitted from our study include intangibles from pain and suffering, resources from care provided by nonpaid caregivers, and the burden associated with undiagnosed diabetes.},

  abstract = {This study provides a multivariate analysis of the availability of food store outlets in the US and associations with neighborhood characteristics on race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES).
Commercial food store outlet data are linked across 28,050 zip codes to Census 2000 data. Multivariate regression analyses are used to examine associations between the availability of chain supermarkets, non-chain supermarkets, grocery stores and convenience stores and neighborhood characteristics on race, ethnicity and SES including additional controls for population size, urbanization and region.
Low-income neighborhoods have fewer chain supermarkets with only 75\% (p $<$ 0.01) of that available in middle-income neighborhoods. Even after controlling for income and other covariates, the availability of chain supermarkets in African American neighborhoods is only 52\% (p $<$ 0.01) of that in White neighborhoods with even less relative availability in urban areas. Hispanic neighborhoods have only 32\% (p $<$ 0.01) as many chain supermarkets compared to non-Hispanic neighborhoods. Non-chain supermarkets and grocery stores are more prevalent in low-income and minority neighborhoods.
The study results highlight the importance of various potential public policy measures for improving access to supermarkets that may serve to reduce systematic local area barriers that are shown to exist by race, ethnicity and income.},

We use data from a large grocery retailer to match transactions that were recorded by the retailer (at the store) and by the Homescan panelist (at home). The matched data allow us to identify and document discrepancies between the two data sets in reported shopping trips, products, prices, and quantities. We find that the discrepancies are largest for the price variable, and show that they are due to two effects: the first seems like standard recording errors (by Nielsen or the panelists), while the second is likely due to the way Nielsen imputes prices. We present two simple applications to illustrate the impact of recording differences, and we use one of the applications to illustrate how the validation study can be used to adjust estimates obtained from Nielsen Homescan data. The results suggest that while recording discrepancies are clearly present and potentially impact results, corrections, like the one we employ, can be adopted by users of Homescan to investigate the robustness of their results to such potential recording differences.},

A significant contribution of our paper is that we compare two types of SSB taxes recently advocated by policy makers: A 20\% flat rate sales (valoric) tax and a 20\,cent/L volumetric tax. Censored demand is accounted for using a two-step procedure. We find that the volumetric tax would result in a greater per capita weight loss than the valoric tax (0.41\,kg vs. 0.29\,kg). The difference between the change in weight is substantial for the target group of heavy purchasers of SSBs in low-income households, with a weight reduction of up to 3.20\,kg for the volumetric and 2.06\,kg for the valoric tax. The average yearly per capita tax burden on low-income households is \$17.87 (0.21\% of income) compared with \$15.17 for high-income households (0.07\% of income) for the valoric tax, and \$13.80 (0.15\%) and \$10.10 (0.04\%) for the volumetric tax. Thus, the tax burden is lower, and weight reduction is higher under a volumetric tax. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Prices of regular sodas jumped by more than the amount of the tax in the month that the tax took effect. The prices of other taxed drinks also rose, though by a smaller amount. Diet soda prices rose as well, suggesting that consumers may have substituted toward diet sodas after regular sodas became taxable.

  abstract = {As economic expansions raise employment and wages, associated shifts in income and time constraints would be expected to also impact individuals' health. This study utilizes information from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (1990-2007) to explore the relationship between the risk of unemployment and the consumption of various healthy and unhealthy foods. Estimates, based on fixed effects methodologies, indicate that a higher risk of unemployment is associated with reduced consumption of fruits and vegetables and increased consumption of ``unhealthy'' foods such as snacks and fast food. In addition to estimation of the average population effect, heterogeneous responses are also identified through detailed sample stratifications and by isolating the effect for those predicted to be at highest risk of unemployment based on their socio-economic characteristics. Among individuals predicted to be at highest risk of being unemployed, a one percentage point increase in the resident state's unemployment rate is associated with a 2-8\% reduction in the consumption of fruits and vegetables. The impact is somewhat higher among married individuals and older adults. Supplementary analyses also explore specific mediating pathways, and point to reduced family income and adverse mental health as significant channels underlying the procyclical nature of healthy food consumption.},

We show that an economy in which agents have ``consumption commitments'' is approximately equivalent to a habit formation model in which the habit stock is a weighted average of past consumption if idiosyncratic risk is large relative to aggregate risk. Consumption commitments can thus explain the empirical regularity that consumption is excessively sensitive and excessively smooth, findings that are typically attributed to habit formation. Unlike habit formation and other theories, but consistent with empirical evidence, the consumption commitments model also predicts that excess sensitivity and smoothness vanish for large shocks. These results suggest that behavior previously attributed to habit formation may be better explained by adjustment costs. We develop additional testable predictions to further distinguish the commitment and habit models and show that the two models have different welfare implications.},

The median confidence interval on ROI is over 100\% wide, the smallest exceeds 50\%. Detailed sales data show that, relative to the per capita cost of the advertising, individual-level sales are incredibly volatile; a coefficient of variation of 10 is common. Hence, informative advertising experiments can easily require more than ten million person-weeks, making experiments costly and potentially infeasible for many firms. Despite these unfavorable economics, randomized control trials represent progress by injecting new, unbiased information into the market. The statistically small impact of profitable advertising amid such noise means that selection bias is a crippling concern for widely-employed observational methods. We discuss how these biases and weak informational feedback from experiments fundamentally impact both advertisers and publishers.},

However, demand shocks have greater effects in reducing unemployment, and increasing labor force participation, if the local economy initially has high unemployment, although these differences are only of modest statistical significance. The estimates are based on a new econometric approach to determining the correct dynamic structure for how local labor markets respond to demand shocks. This new approach finds that demand shocks have persistent effects on labor force participation and real wages, but not on unemployment, which contradicts some previous research.},

  abstract = {Introduction
The US Department of Agriculture has stocking criteria for healthy foods among Supplemental Nutrition Assistant Program (SNAP)-authorized retailers. Increased access to healthy food could improve diet quality among SNAP participants, which has implications for chronic disease prevention. The objective of this study was to quantify healthy foods stocked in small-size to mid-size retailers who are authorized under SNAP but not under the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).

Methods
We used formative, cross-sectional data from a large policy evaluation to conduct secondary analyses. Store audits were conducted in 2014 in 91 randomly selected, licensed food stores in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. Supermarkets and retailers participating in WIC, which are required to stock healthy foods, were excluded as were other stores not reasonably expected to stock staple foods, such as specialty stores or produce stands. Availability of milk, fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain\textendash{}rich foods was assessed.

Results
The 91 stores studied were corner stores, food\textendash{}gas marts, dollar stores, and pharmacies. More than half carried 1 or more varieties of fat-free or low-fat milk, fresh or canned fruit, and whole-grain\textendash{}rich cereal. However, only one-third stocked 1 or more varieties of fresh vegetables and only one-quarter stocked whole-grain\textendash{}rich products, such as whole-grain-rich bread (26\%) or tortillas (21\%) or brown rice (25\%). Few stores stocked at least 2 varieties of each product.

Conclusions
Many stores did not stock a variety of healthy foods. The US Department of Agriculture should change policies to improve minimum stocking requirements for SNAP-authorized retailers.},

However, misspecification of the consumer demand system can result in biased econometric results and misleading conclusions. We discuss some considerations that go into choosing a demand system specification and suggest that a `flexible functional form' be used. This approach avoids placing restrictions on the demand elasticities. We identify and discuss other issues that arise in the estimation of demand systems. We conclude with an empirical example concerning the calculation of lost profits damages in a patent infringement case. This example demonstrates how using a flexible functional form leads to a substantially more reliable damages calculation than using the particular restrictive functional form that is commonly used to calculate lost profits damages in patent litigation.},

Reviews of the impacts of these policies show that the effects are often modest.

The goal of this paper is to review theoretical and empirical studies focusing on changes in the food supply induced by alternative policies, and to attempt to draw from them policy guidelines and conjectures to test in future research.},

  title = {Has {{Consumption Inequality Mirrored Income Inequality}}?},
  abstract = {We revisit to what extent the increase in income inequality over the last 30 years has been mirrored by consumption inequality. We do so by constructing two alternative measures of consumption expenditure, using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE). We first use reports of active savings and after tax income to construct the measure of consumption implied by the budget constraint. We find that the consumption inequality implied by savings behavior largely tracks income inequality between 1980 and 2007. Second, we use a demand system to correct for systematic measurement error in the CE's expenditure data. Specifically, we consider trends in the relative expenditure of high income and low income households for different goods with different income (total expenditure) elasticities. Our estimation exploits the difference in the growth rate of luxury consumption inequality versus necessity consumption inequality. This "double-differencing,'' which we implement in a a regression framework, corrects for mis-measurement that can systematically vary over time by good and income group. This second exercise indicates that consumption inequality has closely tracked income inequality over the period 1980-2007. Both of our measures show a significantly greater increase in consumption inequality than what is obtained from the CE's total household expenditure data directly.},

The proposed inferential procedures are computationally convenient in typical applications and can be carried out using software available for ordinary quantile regression. Our inferential procedure arises naturally from an estimation algorithm and has the important feature of being robust to weak and partial identification and remains valid even in cases where identification fails completely. The use of the proposed procedures is illustrated through two empirical examples.},

Declining food prices over time have been singled out as a main contributor, for example, to the rising trend in obesity. In this paper we use data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the American Chamber of Commerce Researchers Association, the Consumer Expenditure Survey, and the United States Department of Agriculture to analyze trends in various types of food prices, to create a food price index, and to estimate the price of a calorie. Results may be used by future researchers in estimating the health implications of these trends. We find that while the general trend in food prices has been declining, that of restaurant meal prices and prices of fruits and vegetables has risen over time. It is doubtful that the decline in food prices has been sufficiently large to account for the large increase in caloric intake that is said to have contributed to the obesity epidemic in the U.S.},

  abstract = {In response to evidence linking obesity and high amounts of dietary fat, the food industry has developed numerous reduced-fat and nonfat food items. These items frequently derive a relatively large percentage of their energy from sugars and the effect of these sugars on weight regulation is not well known. We studied the comparative effects of high- and low-sucrose, low-fat, hypoenergetic diets on a variety of metabolic and behavioral indexes in a 6-wk weight-loss program. Both diets contained approximately 4606 kJ energy/d with 11\% of energy as fat, 19\% as protein, and 71\% as carbohydrate. The high-sucrose diet contained 43\% of the total daily energy intake as sucrose; the low-sucrose diet contained 4\% of the total daily energy intake as sucrose. Twenty women aged 40.6 +/- 8.2 y (mean +/- SD) with a body mass index (in kg/m2) of 35.93 +/- 4.8 consumed the high-sucrose diet; 22 women aged 40.3 +/- 7.3 y with a body mass index of 34.93 +/- 4.4 consumed the low-sucrose diet. Mixed-design analysis of variance showed a main effect of time (P $<$ 0.01), with both diet groups showing decreases in weight, blood pressure, resting energy expenditure, percentage body fat, free triiodothyronine (FT3), urinary norepinephrine, and plasma lipids. Small but significant interactions were found between group and time in total cholesterol (P = 0.009) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (P = 0.01). Both groups showed decreases in depression, hunger, and negative mood, and increases in vigilance and positive mood with time (P $<$ 0.01). Results showed that a high sucrose content in a hypoenergetic, low-fat diet did not adversely affect weight loss, metabolism, plasma lipids, or emotional affect.},

It describes traditional economic approaches emphasizing utility maximization that, under certain assumptions, result in Pareto-optimal outcomes and a limited role for policy interventions. It also details nontraditional models (e.g. involving hyperbolic time discounting or bounded rationality) that even without market imperfections can result in suboptimal outcomes for which government intervention has greater potential to increase social welfare. The chapter summarizes the literature on the consequences of risky health behaviors for economic outcomes such as medical care costs, educational attainment, employment, wages, and crime. It also reviews the research on policies and strategies with the potential to modify risky health behaviors, such as taxes or subsidies, cash incentives, restrictions on purchase and use, providing information and restricting advertising.

The positive deviance approach could be appropriate for creating class-appropriate, healthy eating menu guides for consuming a diet to minimize cancer risk in Guatemala. Guatemalan adult participants (n = 873) were enrolled in the Concordance Project from 3 socioeconomic strata: rural area (n = 301), lower urban (n = 298), and higher urban (n = 274). Participants with intakes below recommended nutrient intakes and current smokers were excluded from the analysis. Concordance with 14 selected WCRF/AICR individual guideline components was evaluated. We selected participants for making a set of 14 rotating menus for a cancer prevention healthy eating guide. A priority sorting through the 873 participants of the survey identified a total of 23 and 21 model participants, respectively, from the rural and urban poor groups (concordant with 12 of 14 recommendation components) and 15 from the urban middle class (concordant with 11 of 14 recommendation components), with the highest degree of concordance with the WCRF/AICR guidelines. The most commonly violated recommendation was sugar consumption, followed by maintaining weight stability. The FFQ for 14 individuals from each class were transformed into a day menu to create a rotating diet guide derived from members of each social group. A potentially useful personal guide for eating compatibly with adequate nutrient intake and reduced cancer risk, appropriate to the culture and economic means of distinct social classes in Guatemala, is approaching the stage for application.},

  abstract = {Recent research has documented that income inequality in the United States has increased dramatically over the prior three decades. There has been less of a consensus, however, on whether the increase in income inequality was matched by an equally large increase in consumption inequality. Most researchers have studied this question using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) and some studies have suggested that the increase in consumption inequality has been modest. Unfortunately ,there is now mounting evidence that the CE is plagued by serious non-classical measurement error, which hinders the extent to which definitive conclusions can be made about the extent to which consumption inequality has evolved over the last three decades. In this paper, we use a variety of different techniques to overcome the measurement error problems with the CE. First, we use data from the diary component of the CE, focusing on categories where measurement error has been found to be less of an issue. Second, we explore inequality measures within the CE using the value of vehicles owned, a consumption component that is considered to be measured well. Third, we try to account directly for the non-classical measurement error of the CE by comparing the spending on luxuries (entertainment) relative to necessities (food). This is similar to the recent approach taken by Browning and Crossley (2009) and Aguiar and Bils (2011). Finally, we use expenditure data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to explore the dynamics of alternative measures of consumption inequality. All of our different methods yield similar results. We find that consumption inequality within the U.S. between 1980 and 2010 has increased by nearly the same amount as income inequality.},

Using the Census Bureau's Supplemental Poverty Measure (which subtracts out-of-pocket medical expenses from family resources), we estimated the impact of eliminating Medicaid.

Counterfactual medical expenditures were drawn stochastically from propensity-score-matched individuals without Medicaid. While this method captures the importance of risk protection, it likely underestimates Medicaid's impact due to unobserved differences between Medicaid and non-Medicaid individuals. Nonetheless, we find that Medicaid reduces out-of-pocket medical spending from \$871 to \$376 per beneficiary, and decreases poverty rates by 1.0\% among children, 2.2\% among disabled adults, and 0.7\% among elderly individuals. When factoring in institutionalized populations, an additional 500,000 people were kept out of poverty.

We find that food expenditure patterns vary systematically across the month within different retail channels by income and SNAP payment schedules. Low-income households in early SNAP distribution areas decrease their grocery and mass/club/superstore expenditures at the end of the calendar month and supplement this decrease with increased food expenditures in convenience stores and food away from home.

  abstract = {Objective
We examined associations between access to food venues (farmers' markets and supermarkets), shopping patterns, fruit and vegetable consumption and health indicators among women of reproductive age in eastern North Carolina, USA.

Design
Access to food venues was measured using a Geographic Information System incorporating distance, seasonality and business hours, to quantify access to farmers' markets. Produce consumption was assessed by self-report of eating five or more fruits and vegetables daily. BMI and blood pressure were assessed by clinical measurements. Poisson regression with robust variance was used for dichotomous outcomes and multiple linear regression was used for continuous outcomes. As the study occurred in a university town and university students are likely to have different shopping patterns from non-students, we stratified analyses by student status.

Setting
Eastern North Carolina.

Subjects
Low-income women of reproductive age (18\textendash{}44 years) with valid address information accessing family planning services at a local health department (n 400).

Results
Over a quarter reported ever shopping at farmers' markets (114/400). A larger percentage of women who shopped at farmers' markets consumed five or more fruits and vegetables daily (42$\cdot$1\%) than those who did not (24$\cdot$0\%; P$<$0$\cdot$001). The mean objectively measured distance to men reported shopping was 11$\cdot$4 (SD 9$\cdot$0) km (7$\cdot$1 (SD 5$\cdot$6) miles), while the mean distance to the farmers' market closest to the residence was 4$\cdot$0 (SD 3$\cdot$7) km (2$\cdot$5 (SD 2$\cdot$3) miles).

Conclusions
Among non-students, those who shopped at farmers' markets were more likely to consume five or more servings of fruits and vegetables daily. Future research should further explore potential health benefits of farmers' markets.},

Overeating in industrial societies is a significant problem, linked to an increasing incidence of overweight and obesity, and the resultant adverse health consequences. We advance the hypothesis that a possible explanation for overeating is that processed foods with high concentrations of sugar and other refined sweeteners, refined carbohydrates, fat, salt, and caffeine are addictive substances. Therefore, many people lose control over their ability to regulate their consumption of such foods. The loss of control over these foods could account for the global epidemic of obesity and other metabolic disorders. We assert that overeating can be described as an addiction to refined foods that conforms to the DSM-IV criteria for substance use disorders. To examine the hypothesis, we relied on experience with self-identified refined foods addicts, as well as critical reading of the literature on obesity, eating behavior, and drug addiction. Reports by self-identified food addicts illustrate behaviors that conform to the 7 DSM-IV criteria for substance use disorders. The literature also supports use of the DSM-IV criteria to describe overeating as a substance use disorder. The observational and empirical data strengthen the hypothesis that certain refined food consumption behaviors meet the criteria for substance use disorders, not unlike tobacco and alcohol. This hypothesis could lead to a new diagnostic category, as well as therapeutic approaches to changing overeating behaviors.},

The strongest evidence for direct health effects is among states in the United States, but even that is somewhat mixed.

Most arguments in describing the ramifications of a tax fail to consider demand interrelationships among various beverages. To circumvent this shortcoming we employ a variation of Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS) model. The consumption of isotonics, regular soft drinks and fruit drinks, the set of SSBs, is negatively impacted by the proposed tax, while the consumption of fruit juices, low-fat milk, coffee, and tea is positively affected. Diversion ratios are provided identifying where the volumes of the SSBs are directed as a result of the tax policy. The reduction in the body weight as a result of a 20\% tax on SSBs is estimated to be between 1.54 and 2.55 lb per year. However, not considering demand interrelationships would result in higher weight loss. Unequivocally, it is necessary to consider interrelationships among non-alcoholic beverages in assessing the effect of the tax.},

We investigate income differences in attentiveness to cigarette taxes, exploiting state and time variation in cigarette excise and sales tax rates. Whereas all consumers respond to taxes that appear in cigarettes' posted price, our results suggest that only low-income consumers respond to taxes levied at the register.},

  abstract = {Bus bunching severely deteriorates the quality of transit service with poor on-time performance and excessive waiting time. To mitigate bus bunching, this paper presents a predictive framework to capture the stop-level headway irregularity based on transit smart card data. Historical headway, passenger demands, and travel time are utilized to model the headway fluctuation at the following stops. A Least Squares Support Vector Machine regression is established to detect bus bunching with the predicted headway pattern. An empirical experiment with two bus routes in Beijing is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The predictive method can successfully identify more than 95\% of bus bunching occurrences in comparison with other well-established prediction algorithms. Moreover, the detection accuracy does not significantly deteriorate as the prediction lead time increases. Instead of regularizing the headways at all costs by adopting certain correction actions, the proposed framework can provide timely and accurate information for potential bus bunching prevention and inform passengers when the next bus will arrive. This feature will greatly increase transit ridership and reduce operating costs for transit authorities.},

Some of these connections have been addressed through sophisticated modeling, revealing a plethora of reasons for heterogeneity in value of time rooted in behavior at a micro scale. This paper reviews what we know and what we need to know.

@phdthesis{demperio_cigarette_2013,
  title = {Cigarette {{Taxes}}, {{Smoking Bans}}, and {{Smoking Behavior}}},
  abstract = {This dissertation examines the effects of policies to reduce smoking on smoking behaviors and health outcomes. In my first chapter, I estimate the effects of cigarette taxes and smoking bans. Though the effects of these policies have been studied separately, no research considers how they interact. Because smoking bans and cigarette taxes target the same behavior in the same individuals, they may reinforce each other and lead to greater reductions in smoking, or they may independently reduce smoking but experience diminishing returns together. Using data from the 1992-2007 Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Surveys, I find that taxes and bans lead to significant increases in quit attempts and quits, and significant decreases in overall smoking prevalence. My results on cessation behaviors imply that these policies increased the rate of quit success, an outcome not previously studied in the literature. Furthermore, I find smaller effects on all outcomes when both taxes and bans are in place, indicating these policies are substitutes rather than complements. Next, I analyze another policy that altered the costs and benefits of smoking: the switch of Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) products from prescription to over-the-counter (OTC) status in 1996. I examine how OTC availability, which decreased the cost of obtaining NRT and the cost of quitting, affected NRT product use and quit attempts. I find this change did not increase quit attempts but did increase NRT use, indicating that it altered how, not whether, smokers attempted to quit. I also analyze the effect of NRT use on the rate of success among quit attempts, using the OTC switch as an instrument for NRT use. I find that the use of NRT products in a quit attempt significantly increases the probability of quit success. This effect is larger than estimates without an instrument, indicating that there is self-selection into NRT product use. Last, I use variation in the timing of local smoking bans to identify the effects of bans on smoking behavior, exposure to other people's cigarette smoke, and health outcomes. Using data from the 1994-2008 California Adult Tobacco Surveys, I find that bans in bars led to a decrease in exposure but an increase in the number of cigarettes smoked at home. These results imply heterogeneous externality effects. While average exposure decreased, those living with smokers, including children, may experience increased exposure to smoke after a ban. Using hospital data from California, I will estimate the effects of bans on health outcomes. I expect that to find that bans lead to improved health outcomes for adults, but not for children.},

  abstract = {Background: How beverage taxes might influence purchases of foods and beverages among households with preschool children is unclear. Thus, we examined the relation between beverage taxes and food and beverage purchases among US households with a child 2\textendash{}5 y of age.
Objectives: We examined how a potential tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), or SSBs and $>$1\% fat and/or high-sugar milk, would influence household food and beverage purchases among US households with a preschool child. We aimed to identify the lowest tax rate associated with meaningful changes in purchases.
Methods: We used household food and beverage purchase data from households with a single child who participated in the 2009\textendash{}2012 Nielsen Homescan Panel. A 2-part, multilevel panel model was used to examine the relation between beverage prices and food and beverage purchases. Logistic regression was used in the first part of the model to estimate the probability of a food/beverage being purchased, whereas the second part of the model used log-linear regression to estimate predicted changes in purchases among reporting households. Estimates from both parts were combined, and bootstrapping was performed to obtain corrected SEs. In separate models, prices of SSBs, or SSBs and $>$1\% and/or high-sugar milk, were perturbed by +10\%, +15\%, and +20\%. Predicted changes in food and beverage purchases were compared across models.
Results: Price increases of 10\%, 15\%, and 20\% on SSBs were associated with fewer purchases of juice drinks, whereas price increases of 10\%, 15\%, and 20\% simulated on both SSBs plus $>$1\% fat and/or high-sugar milk (combined tax) were associated with fewer kilocalories purchased from $>$1\% fat, low-sugar milk, and meat, poultry, fish, and mixed meat dishes.
Conclusions: Our study provides further evidence that a tax on beverages high in sugar and/or fat may be associated with favorable changes in beverage purchases among US households with a preschool child.},

  abstract = {The food demand in India has been examined in the context of a structural shift in the dietary pattern of its population. The results have reinforced the hypothesis of a significant diversification in the dietary pattern of households in recent years and has found stark differences in the consumption pattern across different income quartiles. The food demand behaviour has been explained using a set of demand elasticities corresponding to major food commodities. The demand elasticities have been estimated using multi-stage budgeting with QUAIDS model and another alternative model, FCDS. The study has revealed that the estimated income elasticities vary across income classes and are lowest for cereals group and highest for horticultural and livestock products. The analysis of price and income effects based on the estimated demand system has suggested that with increase in food price inflation, the demand for staple food (rice, wheat and sugar) may not be affected adversely but, that of high-value food commodities is likely to be affected negatively. Therefore, the study has cautioned that if inflation in food prices remains unabated for an extended period, there is the possibility of reversal of the trend of diversification and that of consumers returning to cereal-dominated diet, thus accentuating under-nourishment.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.appet.2015.05.011},
  abstract = {Background: Adequate fruit and vegetable consumption has been linked to reductions in all-cause mortality, stroke, and cancer. Unfortunately, less than half of Canadians aged 65+ meet the standard international guideline for adequate consumption ($\geq$5 servings per day). Among older adults, social isolation and low social support are barriers to proper nutrition, but the effects of specific types of social support on adequate fruit and vegetable consumption are unknown. Objective: This study sought to test hypotheses regarding direct and indirect pathways through which tangible and emotional/informational social support may facilitate adequate fruit and vegetable consumption among older adults. Methods: Analyzing 2008\textendash{}2009 Canadian Community Health Survey \textendash{} Healthy Aging component data (n\,=\,14,221), logistic regression models were developed to examine associations between tangible and emotional/informational social support, eating behaviors (eating alone and preparing one's own meals), and meeting the recommended guideline of consuming $\geq$5 servings of fruit and vegetables per day. Results: In pooled models, emotional/informational support was positively associated with adequate fruit and vegetable consumption (OR\,=\,1.16; 95\% CI\,=\,1.07, 1.27). Among men, neither social support form was directly or indirectly associated with adequate consumption; among women, adequate consumption was negatively associated with tangible support but positively associated with higher emotional/informational support. Both of these associations were mediated by not usually cooking one's own meals. Conclusions: Programs and policies that seek to foster social support for older adults as a means of ensuring proper nutrition should consider the nuanced mechanisms through which different social support forms may operate for men and women.},

These models have been used extensively in the theoretical literature on product differentiation and the goal of this article is to translate them into a form that is useful for empirical work. Most recent econometric applications of discrete choice models implicitly let the dimension of the characteristic space increase with the number of products (they have ``tastes for products''). The two models have different theoretical properties, and these, in turn, can have quite pronounced implications for both substitution patterns and for the welfare impacts of changes in the number and characteristics of the goods marketed. After developing those properties, we provide alternative algorithms for estimating the parameters of the pure characteristic model and compare their properties to those of the algorithm for estimating the model with tastes for products. We conclude with a series of Monte Carlo results. These are designed to illustrate: (i) the computational properties of the alternative algorithms for computing the pure characteristic model, and (ii) the differences in the implications of the pure characteristic model from the models with tastes for products.},

  abstract = {We present new identification results for nonparametric models of differentiated products markets, using only market level observables. We specify a nonparametric random utility discrete choice model of demand allowing rich preference heterogeneity, product/market unobservables, and endogenous prices. Our supply model posits nonparametric cost functions, allows latent cost shocks, and nests a range of standard oligopoly models. We consider identification of demand, identification of changes in aggregate consumer welfare, identification of marginal costs, identification of firms' marginal cost functions, and discrimination between alternative models of firm conduct. We explore two complementary approaches. The first demonstrates identification under the same nonparametric instrumental variables conditions required for identification of regression models. The second treats demand and supply in a system of nonparametric simultaneous equations, leading to constructive proofs exploiting exogenous variation in demand shifters and cost shifters. We also derive testable restrictions that provide the first general formalization of Bresnahan's (1982) intuition for empirically distinguishing between alternative models of oligopoly competition. From a practical perspective, our results clarify the types of instrumental variables needed with market level data, including tradeoffs between functional form and exclusion restrictions.},

  abstract = {One of the most commonly-proposed policies to address the high prevalence of obesity is a tax on energy-dense foods, in particular sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). This is based on the assumption that such taxes are largely passed through to consumers in the form of higher retail prices, leading to reduced consumption. However, relatively little is known about the extent to which taxes on SSBs are in fact passed through to consumers. We estimate the pass-through of the first city-level tax on SSBs in the U.S., which was enacted by the voters of Berkeley, California in November, 2014. We collected the prices of various brands and sizes of SSBs and other beverages before and after the implementation of the tax from a near-census of convenience stores and supermarkets in Berkeley, California. We also collected prices from stores in a control city: San Francisco, where in 2014 a similar voter referendum failed despite majority support. Estimates from difference-in-differences and other models consistently indicate that there was relatively little pass through of the Berkeley SSB tax to consumers; across brands and sizes, we estimate that retail prices rose by less than half of the amount of the tax. This is in contrast to much of the previous literature on the pass-through of taxes, which tended to find full or even overshifting of taxes.},

The government provides goods and services such as registration of births and deaths, public health surveillance of disease and injury, outbreak investigations, research and education, health insurance for the poor and elderly, enforcement of laws and regulations, evaluation of health promotion programs, and assurance of a competent healthy workforce. In the past, economics in public health has almost exclusively focused on efficiency of programs through the use of cost-effectiveness or net present value measures clustered under the rubric of "economic evaluation." Efficiency measures are useful at the programmatic level. However, lack of full employment and market failures including public goods and the impact of consumers and producers actions not reflected in the markets (externalities) not only compromise efficiency but also generate health inequities. We propose an expansion of the scope of existing health economics research in an area characterized as public health economics-the study of the economic role of government in public health, particularly, but not exclusively, in supplying public goods and addressing externalities., (C) 2007 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

  abstract = {Thirty years ago international nutritionists were focussing on childhood malnutrition, the `protein gap' and how to feed the world's burgeoning population, and medical services in the developing world were concentrated on the fight against infectious diseases. Today the World Health Organization (WHO) finds itself needing to deal with the new pandemic of obesity and its accompanying non-communicable diseases (NCDs) while the challenge of childhood malnutrition has far from disappeared, TB and malaria rates are escalating, and the scourge of AIDS has emerged. This has created a `double burden' of disease that threatens to overwhelm the health services of many resource-poor countries. WHO warns that the greater future burden of obesity and diabetes will affect developing countries, and the projected numbers of new cases of diabetes run into the hundreds of millions within the next 2 decades. The obesity pandemic originated in the US and crossed to Europe and the world's other rich nations before, remarkably, it penetrated even the world's poorest countries especially in their urban areas. The pandemic is transmitted through the vectors of subsidized agriculture and multinational companies providing cheap, highly refined fats, oils, and carbohydrates, labour-saving mechanized devices, affordable motorized transport, and the seductions of sedentary pastimes such as television. This paper briefly reviews these macro-environmental trends as well as considering some of the socio-behavioural influences on weight gain in traditional societies. It concludes, pessimistically, that the pandemic will continue to spread for the foreseeable future, and that, apart from educational campaigns, the governments and health services of poor countries will have few effective public health levers with which they can try to arrest the trend.},

Additionally, firms can easily observe and measure consumer behavior. We start by asking what consumers can offer in exchange for digital goods. We suggest that consumers can offer their money, personal information, or time. Firms, in turn, can generate revenue by selling digital content, brokering consumer information, or showing advertising. We discuss the firm's trade-off in choosing between the different revenue streams, such as offering paid content or free content while relying on advertising revenues. We then turn to specific challenges firms face when choosing a revenue model based on either content, information or advertising. Additionally, we discuss nascent revenue models that combine different revenue streams such as crowdfunding (content and information) or blogs (information and advertising). We conclude with a discussion of opportunities for future research including implications for firms' revenues models from the increasing importance of the mobile internet.},

We motivate the choice of the Tobit model as a statistical representation of consumer behavior and introduce the methodology by specifying the AIDS model modified according to both a translating and scaling demographic transformation. We propose to estimate each demand equation in unrestricted form using the jackknife technique. We then recover the demand parameters imposing the cross-equations restrictions by using minimum distance estimation.

The current study assessed whether participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP; formerly the Food Stamp Program), Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or California Work Opportunities and Responsibilities to Kids (CalWorks) was associated with obesity, independent of socio-economic status and food insecurity.DesignA cross-sectional analysis of the 2007 Adult California Health Interview Survey. Outcome measures included BMI and obesity. Distribution of BMI and prevalence of obesity were compared by participation in each programme, using weighted linear and binomial regression models in which BMI or obesity was the outcome, respectively, and programme participation was the predictor.SettingA population survey of various health measures.SubjectsNon-institutionalized adults (n 7741) whose household income was $\leq$130 \% of the federal poverty level.ResultsThe prevalence of obesity was 27$\cdot$4 \%. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, food insecurity and participation in other programmes, the prevalence of obesity was 30 \% higher in SNAP participants (95 \% CI 6 \%, 59 \%; P = 0$\cdot$01) than in non-participants. This association was more pronounced among men than women. SSI participation was related to an adjusted 50 \% higher prevalence of obesity (95 \% CI 27 \%, 77 \%; P $<$ 0$\cdot$0001) compared with no participation. SNAP and SSI participants also reported higher soda consumption than non-participants of any programme. CalWorks participation was not associated with obesity after multivariable adjustment.ConclusionsParticipation in SNAP or SSI was associated with obesity independent of food insecurity or socio-economic status. The suggestion that these associations may be mediated by dietary quality warrants further investigation among low-income populations.},

This study applies the generalized composite commodity theorem (GCCT) developed by Lewbel (1996), to test the aggregation of French household demand of salmon. The results indicate that demand for salmon can be aggregated based on product form (i.e., fresh, frozen, and smoked salmon). These composites can be further aggregated into a single salmon category. Salmon demand can, therefore, be estimated using a system which only includes salmon equations. The composite demand elasticities estimated by the AIDS model suggest that fresh and smoked salmon significantly substitute each other in the French salmon market. This means that the estimation of an import demand system that does not include smoked salmon cannot really explain real consumer demand. The results also suggest that wild salmon is playing in a different market niche than farmed salmon.},

To determine whether participation in a farmers' market incentive pilot program had an impact on food security and fruit and vegetable (F\&amp;V) intake of participants.
Methods
Participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program were eligible to receive a dollar-per-dollar match up to \$10/wk in farmers' market incentives. The researchers used a pretest-posttest design to measure F\&amp;V intake and food security status of 54 adult participants before and after receiving farmers' market incentives. The 6-item Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System questionnaire and US Household Food Security Survey Module were used to measure F\&amp;V intake and food security, respectively. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare scores of F\&amp;V intake.
Results
After receiving incentives, fewer individuals reported experiencing food insecurity\textendash{}related behaviors. A significantly increased intake (P \&lt; .05) was found among selected vegetables.
Conclusion and Implications
Participation in a farmers' market incentive program was positively related to greater food security and intake of select vegetables among participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.},

Contrary to conventional wisdom, the formulas imply that the economic incidence of a tax depends on its statutory incidence and that a tax can create deadweight loss even if it induces no change in demand. The results are derived using simple supply and demand diagrams and familiar notions of consumer and producer surplus. The approach to welfare analysis proposed here yields robust formulas because it does not require specification of a positive theory for why agents fail to optimize with respect to tax policies.},

Most reliable information from each sample is exploited to derive a correction for the measurement error affecting observed measures of consumption inequality in the two surveys. We find that consumption inequality, as measured by the standard deviation of log non-durable consumption, has increased by roughly 5\% points during the 1990s.},

  abstract = {We use the Anti-Alcohol Campaign in 1986 and the rapid expansion of the beer market after the collapse of the Soviet Union as two quasi-natural experiments to identify highly persistent habit formation in alcohol consumption among Russian males. Importantly, these results apply to all levels of alcohol consumption and are not driven by heavy drinking or alcoholism. The two large shocks combined with persistent habits lead to large cohort differences in consumer behavior even decades later. We derive a basic model of habit formation with homogeneous preferences over two habit-forming goods, which is consistent with these facts. Using placebo tests as well as simple descriptive statistics, we show that habits are formed during early adulthood and remain largely unaffected afterward. The main alternative hypotheses such as income effects, unobserved taste heterogeneity, stepping-stone effects, and changes in culture or social norms are inconsistent with those patterns. Using the experiments as IVs, we estimate the first-order autoregressive coefficient to be 0.83, which is almost three times larger than its OLS estimate. Finally, our results suggest that male mortality in Russia will decrease by one quarter within twenty years even under current policies and prices due to the long-run consequences of the large changes in the alcohol market.},

Because obesity is more prevalent among the poor some have raised concerns that food assistance programs may encourage excess weight. This paper investigates whether the U.S. Food Stamp Program contributes to adult participants' weight as measured by body mass index (BMI). Results suggest that the typical female food stamp participant's BMI is indeed more than 1 unit higher than someone with the same socioeconomic characteristics who is not in the program. For the average American woman, who is 5 ft 4 in. (1.63 m) tall, this means an increase in weight of 5.8 pounds (2.6 kg). While this association does not prove that the Food Stamp Program causes weight gain, it does suggest that program changes to encourage the consumption of high-nutrient, low-calorie foods should be considered.},

However, when smuggling incentives are eradicated, the price elasticity is negative but still inelastic.

This paper estimates the extent to which (falling) housing prices and (rising) social transfers can account for this fact using a spatial equilibrium model. Nonlinear reduced form estimates of the model using U.S. Census data document that positive labor demand shocks increase population more than negative shocks reduce population, this asymmetry is larger for low-skill workers, and such an asymmetry is absent for wages, housing values, and rental prices. GMM estimates of the full model suggest that the comparative immobility of low-skill workers is not due to higher mobility costs per se, but rather a lower incidence of adverse labor demand shocks.},

  abstract = {Introduction
This paper examined patterns in adults' sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption and caloric intake by Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participation status and by source of purchases in the United States (US).
Method
Cross-sectional analysis of consumption of SSBs by source of purchases using 24-hour dietary recall data obtained from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003\textendash{}2010 (N = 17,891). Bivariate analysis and multivariable regressions were used to examine the association between SNAP participation and SSB calories consumed overall and by source.
Results
SSBs account for approximately 12\% of total daily caloric intake (258 kcal) among SNAP participants, higher than that of SNAP-eligible nonparticipants (9\% total daily intake, 205 kcal) and SNAP-ineligible nonparticipants (6\% total daily intake, 153 kcal). Among income-eligible adults, participating in SNAP is associated with 28.9 additional SSB calories, of which most were obtained from a store. From 2003\textendash{}04 to 2009\textendash{}10, SSB prevalence and caloric intake were flat among SNAP participants while it declined among both SNAP-eligible and SNAP-ineligible nonparticipants; this pattern held for all sources of SSBs except for those purchased from fast-food restaurants, which were not statistically reduced among nonparticipants.
Conclusion
SNAP participants consumed more SSB calories compared to SNAP-eligible nonparticipants; and their SSB prevalence and caloric intake trend was flat over the 2003\textendash{}04 to 2009\textendash{}10 period. SNAP-Education interventions that focus on improving access to healthy food in poor neighborhoods may benefit SNAP participants.},

This article examines whether altering the cost of unhealthy, energy-dense foods, compared with healthy, less-dense foods through the use of fiscal pricing (tax or subsidy) policy instruments would, in fact, change food consumption patterns and overall diet enough to significantly reduce individuals' weight outcomes. Methods: This article examined empirical evidence regarding the food and restaurant price sensitivity of weight outcomes based on a literature search to identify peer-reviewed English-language articles published between 1990 and 2008. Studies were identified from the Medline, PubMed, Econlit, and PAIS databases. The fifteen search combinations used the terms obesity, body mass index, and BMI each in combination with the terms price, prices, tax, taxation, and subsidy. Findings: The studies reviewed showed that when statistically significant associations were found between food and restaurant prices (taxes) and weight outcomes, the effects were generally small in magnitude, although in some cases they were larger for low\textendash{}socioeconomic status (SES) populations and for those at risk for overweight or obesity. Conclusions: The limited existing evidence suggests that small taxes or subsidies are not likely to produce significant changes in BMI or obesity prevalence but that nontrivial pricing interventions may have some measurable effects on Americans' weight outcomes, particularly for children and adolescents, low-SES populations, and those most at risk for overweight. Additional research is needed to be able to draw strong policy conclusions regarding the effectiveness of fiscal-pricing interventions aimed at reducing obesity.},

  abstract = {We propose robust methods for inference about the effect of a treatment variable on a scalar outcome in the presence of very many regressors in a model with possibly non-Gaussian and heteroscedastic disturbances. We allow for the number of regressors to be larger than the sample size. To make informative inference feasible, we require the model to be approximately sparse; that is, we require that the effect of confounding factors can be controlled for up to a small approximation error by including a relatively small number of variables whose identities are unknown. The latter condition makes it possible to estimate the treatment effect by selecting approximately the right set of regressors. We develop a novel estimation and uniformly valid inference method for the treatment effect in this setting, called the ``post-double-selection'' method. The main attractive feature of our method is that it allows for imperfect selection of the controls and provides confidence intervals that are valid uniformly across a large class of models. In contrast, standard post-model selection estimators fail to provide uniform inference even in simple cases with a small, fixed number of controls. Thus, our method resolves the problem of uniform inference after model selection for a large, interesting class of models. We also present a generalization of our method to a fully heterogeneous model with a binary treatment variable. We illustrate the use of the developed methods with numerical simulations and an application that considers the effect of abortion on crime rates.},

The evidence on this association between countries is mixed,1\textendash{}4 but income inequality and health have been linked within the United States,5\textendash{}11 Britain,12 and Brazil.13 Questions remain over how to interpret these findings and the mechanisms involved. We discuss three interpretations of the association between income inequality and health: the individual income interpretation, the psychosocial environment interpretation, and the neo-material interpretation.

\#\#\#\# Summary points

Income inequality has generally been associated with differences in health

A psychosocial interpretation of health inequalities, in terms of perceptions of relative disadvantage and the psychological consequences of inequality, raises several conceptual and empirical problems

Income inequality is accompanied by many differences in conditions of life at the individual and population levels, which may adversely influence health

Interpretation of links between income inequality and health must begin with the structural causes of inequalities, and not just focus on perceptions of that inequality

Reducing health inequalities and improving public health in the 21st century requires strategic investment in neo-material conditions via more equitable distribution of public and private resources

We reviewed the literature through traditional and electronic means and supplemented this with correlational analyses of gross domestic product and life expectancy and of income inequality and mortality trends based on data from the World Bank,14 the World Health Organization,15 and two British sources.16 17

According to the individual income interpretation, aggregate level associations between income inequality and health reflect only the individual level association between income and health. The curvilinear relation between income and health at the individual level 18 19 is a sufficient condition to produce health differences between populations with the same average income but different distributions of income.3 20 This interpretation assumes that determinants \ldots{}},

A model that is much more consistent with existing evidence on smoking decisions is a time-inconsistent formulation where excise taxes on cigarettes serve a self-control function that is valued by smokers who would like to quit but cannot. This self-control function benefits lower income groups more, since they have a significantly higher price sensitivity of smoking. Calibrations show that, as a result, cigarette taxes are much less regressive than previously assumed, and are even progressive for a wide variety of parameter values.},

  abstract = {Context
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is an effective component in reducing food insecurity in the U.S. In the discussion of strategies to also help SNAP participants maximize diet quality, it is important to know their current dietary patterns and food choices. This paper provides a systematic review of recent U.S. studies on dietary quality, food consumption, and spending among SNAP participants as compared to income-eligible and higher-income nonparticipants.
Evidence acquisition
The review, completed in 2014, summarized studies that were peer-reviewed, published between January 2003 and August 2014, and provided data on dietary quality and intake of SNAP participants and nonparticipants.
Evidence synthesis
Twenty-five studies were included in this review. Daily caloric, macronutrient, and micronutrient intake of SNAP participants did not differ systematically from those of income-eligible nonparticipants; however, differences in dietary quality emerged. Adult SNAP participants scored lower on the Healthy Eating Index than either group of nonparticipants. Children's diets were similar among SNAP participants and low-income nonparticipants, but were less nutritious than diets of higher-income children. The evidence regarding sugar-sweetened beverage consumption was mixed, with most studies indicating significantly higher beverage intake among SNAP participants compared with higher-income nonparticipants, but no difference compared to income-eligible nonparticipants.
Conclusions
SNAP effectively alleviates food insecurity in terms of caloric, macronutrient, and micronutrient intake. Still, SNAP participants are struggling more than income-eligible and higher-income nonparticipants to meet key dietary guidelines. Future policies should ensure that this vital food assistance program addresses diet quality while reducing food insecurity.},

Our estimator employs a penalized pre-estimation model specification stage to consistently estimate nonlinear features of the BLP model. We then perform selection via a Triple-LASSO for explanatory controls, treatment selection controls, and instrument selection. After selecting variables, we use an unpenalized GMM estimator for inference. Monte Carlo simulations verify the performance of these estimators.},

  abstract = {SummaryBackground
The theory that income inequality and characteristics of the psychosocial environment (indexed by such things as social capital and sense of control over life's circumstances) are key determinants of health and could account for health differences between countries has become influential in health inequalities research and for population health policy.
Methods
We examined cross-sectional associations between income inequality and low birthweight, life expectancy, self-rated health, and age-specific and cause-specific mortality among countries providing data in wave III (around 1989\textendash{}92) of the Luxembourg Income Study. We also used data from the 1990\textendash{}91 wave of the World Values Survey (WVS). We obtained life expectancy, mortality, and low birthweight data from the WHO Statistical Information System.
Findings
Among the countries studied, higher income inequality was strongly associated with greater infant mortality (r=0$\cdot$69, p=0$\cdot$004 for women; r=0$\cdot$74, p=0$\cdot$002 for men). Associations between income inequality and mortality declined with age at death, and then reversed among those aged 65 years and older. Income inequality was inconsistently associated with specific causes of death and was not associated with coronary heart disease (CHD), breast or prostate cancer, cirrhosis, or diabetes mortality. Countries that had greater trade union membership and political representation by women had better child mortality profiles. Differences between countries in levels of social capital showed generally weak and somewhat inconsistent associations with cause-specific and age-specific mortality.
Interpretation
Income inequality and characteristics of the psychosocial environment like trust, control, and organisational membership do not seem to be key factors in understanding health differences between these wealthy countries. The associations that do exist are largely limited to child health outcomes and cirrhosis. Explanations for between-country differences in health will require an appreciation of the complex interactions of history, culture, politics, economics, and the status of women and ethnic minorities.},

This study provided a systematic review of recent U.S. studies on the price elasticity of demand for sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), fast food, and fruits and vegetables, as well as the direct associations of prices/taxes with body weight outcomes. Based on the recent literature, the price elasticity of demand for SSBs, fast food, fruits and vegetables was estimated to be -1.21, -0.52, -0.49 and -0.48, respectively. The studies that linked soda taxes to weight outcomes showed minimal impacts on weight; however, they were based on existing state-level sales taxes that were relatively low. Higher fast-food prices were associated with lower weight outcomes particularly among adolescents, suggesting that raising prices would potentially impact weight outcomes. Lower fruit and vegetable prices were generally found to be associated with lower body weight outcomes among both low-income children and adults, suggesting that subsidies that would reduce the cost of fruits and vegetables for lower-socioeconomic populations may be effective in reducing obesity. Pricing instruments should continue to be considered and evaluated as potential policy instruments to address public health risks.},

Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews XX(X), XXX\textendash{}XXX]. The experimental question is whether or not sugar can be a substance of abuse and lead to a natural form of addiction. ``Food addiction'' seems plausible because brain pathways that evolved to respond to natural rewards are also activated by addictive drugs. Sugar is noteworthy as a substance that releases opioids and dopamine and thus might be expected to have addictive potential. This review summarizes evidence of sugar dependence in an animal model. Four components of addiction are analyzed. ``Bingeing,'' ``withdrawal,'' ``craving'' and ``cross-sensitization'' are each given operational definitions and demonstrated behaviorally with sugar bingeing as the reinforcer. These behaviors are then related to neurochemical changes in the brain that also occur with addictive drugs. Neural adaptations include changes in dopamine and opioid receptor binding, enkephalin mRNA expression and dopamine and acetylcholine release in the nucleus accumbens. The evidence supports the hypothesis that under certain circumstances rats can become sugar dependent. This may translate to some human conditions as suggested by the literature on eating disorders and obesity.},

Obesity is associated with increased risk of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), hypertension, cardiovascular disease, gallbladder disease and cholecystectomy, and colon and postmenopausal breast cancer. Using a prevalence-based approach to cost of illness, we estimated the economic costs in 1986 attributable to obesity for these medical conditions. Indirect costs due to morbidity and mortality were discounted at 4\%. Overall, the costs attributable to obesity were \$11.3 billion for NIDDM, \$22.2 billion for cardiovascular disease, \$2.4 billion for gall bladder disease, \$1.5 billion for hypertension, and \$1.9 billion for breast and colon cancer. Thus a conservative estimate of the economic costs of obesity was \$39.3 billion, or 5.5\% of the costs of illness in 1986. Addition of costs due to musculoskeletal disorders could raise this estimate to 7.8\%. The costs of treatment for severe obesity must be weighed against the improved health status and quality of life.},

Although obesity has strong genetic determinants, it is generally accepted that it results from an imbalance between food intake and daily physical activity. Health guidelines have been focused on 3 particular lifestyle factors: increased levels of physical activity and reductions in the intakes of fat and sugars. The dietary guidelines, especially, are under debate. This review covers evidence from carefully controlled laboratory studies, clinical trials, studies in populations at high risk of developing obesity, and epidemiologic studies on the role of sugars, particularly sucrose, in the development of obesity. Although many environmental factors promote a positive energy balance, it is clear that the consumption of a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet increases the likelihood of weight gain. The evidence related to carbohydrate, particularly sugars, and the type of food (solid or liquid) is less clear because the number of long-term ad libitum dietary intervention trials is very small. Data on sucrose intake in relation to metabolism and weight gain do not associate high consumption of sucrose with the prevalence of obesity. The evidence supports the current dietary guidelines for reducing fat intake. However, the effect of the carbohydrate source and class and of the form in which carbohydrate is consumed (solid or liquid) on body weight control requires further consideration.},

  abstract = {Using a sample of 2849 commuters in Northern California, this paper offers a first effort to identify latent constructs associated with a general orientation toward waiting. The bi-factor analysis of 11 items revealed a single dimension capturing a general like/dislike of waiting, together with two domain-specific factors representing attitudes of ``waiting is OK if I expect it'' and ``I don't need to be equipped when waiting''. We compared mean factor scores across socio-economic groups based successively on gender, income, presence of children, primary commute mode, and the number of productivity tools carried on the commute. Although sample size contributed to statistical significance, effect sizes in most cases were modest. Nevertheless, women tended to have more favorable attitudes toward waiting than men (including a greater tolerance of expected waiting and a greater inclination to be equipped). Higher-income respondents tended to view waiting less favorably, and were more inclined to be equipped to wait. Those with children at home were less tolerant of expected waiting than others. Users of public transit or active commute modes (walking/biking) tended to view waiting more positively. Respondents who are more tolerant of waiting and have a proclivity to be equipped for a wait event tend to carry more productivity tools during their regular commute, such as books and magazines, tablets, smartphones, and music players.},

Previous comparable estimates of the economic costs of poor diet, physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol and overweight/obesity were based on economic data from 1992\textendash{}93.
Methods Diseases associated with poor diet, physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol and overweight/obesity were identified. Risk factor-specific population attributable fractions for these diseases were applied to disease-specific estimates of the economic cost to the NHS in the UK in 2006\textendash{}07.
Results In 2006\textendash{}07, poor diet-related ill health cost the NHS in the UK \textsterling{}5.8 billion. The cost of physical inactivity was \textsterling{}0.9 billion. Smoking cost was \textsterling{}3.3 billion, alcohol cost \textsterling{}3.3 billion, overweight and obesity cost \textsterling{}5.1 billion.
Conclusion The estimates of the economic cost of risk factors for chronic disease presented here are based on recent financial data and are directly comparable. They suggest that poor diet is a behavioural risk factor that has the highest impact on the budget of the NHS, followed by alcohol consumption, smoking and physical inactivity.},

This study engaged leading experts for in-depth, semi-structured interviews to explore their opinions concerning the existing challenges and barriers to eating nutritiously in SNAP. Experts also proposed strategies for improving nutritional status among SNAP recipients. Twenty-seven individuals were interviewed from advocacy, government, industry, and research organizations. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed for thematic content. The high cost of nutrient-rich foods, inadequate SNAP benefits, limited access to purchasing healthy foods, and environmental factors associated with poverty were identified as barriers that influence nutrition among low-income households in the United States. Six themes emerged among respondents from diverse sectors about how to address these challenges, including providing SNAP participants with incentives to purchase nutrient-rich food consistent with the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, restricting the purchase of nutrient-poor foods and beverages with program benefits, modifying the frequency of SNAP benefit distribution, enhancing nutrition education, improving the SNAP retailer environment, and increasing state and federal level coordination and consistency of program implementation. Given the recent dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment, policymakers must address existing barriers as well as consider new strategies to improve nutrition policies in SNAP so that the program can continue to address food insecurity needs as well as provide a healthful diet for SNAP beneficiaries.},

Some have proposed vending machine restrictions and taxing soft drinks to curb children's consumption of soft drinks; to a large extent, these policies have not been evaluated empirically. We examine these policies using two nationally representative data sets and find no evidence that, as currently practiced, either is effective at reducing children's weight. We conclude by outlining changes that may increase their effectiveness, such as implementing comprehensive restrictions on access to soft drinks in schools and imposing higher tax rates than are currently in place in many jurisdictions.

  abstract = {This study explores the role of service reliability in determining bus transit ridership. Using stop level service supply, demand, and performance data from the Los Angeles Metro bus system, I investigate whether reliability of a directional line serving a stop influences the number of passengers boarding the line at that stop, controlling for various other established factors affecting demand. This cross-sectional analysis of the variation in line boardings across about 1300 sample schedule time point bus stops served by about 300 directional bus lines over a six-month period uses a historical archive of real-time geo-referenced vehicle location data, and focuses on five different time periods, peaks and off-peaks, of a typical weekday. By evaluating two measures that capture different dimensions of bus service reliability, and by estimating a series of regression models, I find systematic evidence that higher average service punctuality (or schedule adherence) and lower variation in schedule deviation over time are associated with greater ridership, all else equal, particularly during the peak periods. This study also provides first empirical evidence that the effect of reliability on peak-period ridership is moderated by headway. The demand for reliability seems to be higher for lines with relatively longer headways. The findings indicate that service reliability influences transit mode choice and/or line/route selection, and suggest that system-wide ridership gains can be expected from reliability improvements. From an urban planning perspective, this study provides more evidence that good service quality can effectively compliment transformations in the urban fabric brought about by coordinated land use \textemdash{} transit plans to promote transit use.},

Computationally, our approach can have speed advantages because we do not repeatedly solve the structural equation at each guess of structural parameters.

  abstract = {This study was undertaken to update and revise the estimate of the economic impact of obesity in the United States. A prevalence-based approach to the cost of illness was used to estimate the economic costs in 1995 dollars attributable toobesity for type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease (CHD), hypertension, gallbladder disease, breast, endometrial and colon cancer, and osteoarthritis. Additionally and independently, excess physician visits, work-lost days, restricted activity, and bed-days attributable to obesity were analyzed cross-sectionally using the 1988 and 1994 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). Direct (personal health care, hospital care, physician services, allied health services, and medications) and indirect costs (lost output as a result of a reduction or cessation of productivity due to morbidity or mortality) are from published reports and inflated to 1995 dollars using the medical component of the consumer price index (CPI) for direct cost and the all-items CPI for indirect cost. Population-attributable risk percents (PAR\%) are estimated from large prospective studies. Excess work-lost days, restricted activity, bed-days, and physician visits are estimated from 88,262 U. S. citizens who participated in the 1988 NHIS and 80,261 who participated in the 1994 NHIS. Sample weights have been incorporated into the NHIS analyses, making these data generalizable to the U. S. population. The total cost attributable to obesity amounted to \$99. 2 billion dollars in 1995. Approximately \$51. 64 billion of those dollars were direct medical costs. Using the 1994 NHIS data, cost of lost productivity attributed to obesity (BMI$\geq$30) was \$3. 9 billion and reflected 39. 2 million days of lost work. In addition, 239 million restricted-activity days, 89. 5 million bed-days, and 62. 6 million physician visits were attributable to obesity in 1994. Compared with 1988 NHIS data, in 1994 the number of restricted-activity days (36\%), bed-days (28\%), and work-lost days (50\%) increased substantially. The number of physician visits attributed to obesity increased 88\% from 1988 to 1994. The economic and personal health costs of overweight and obesity are enormous and compromise the health of the United States. The direct costs associated with obesity represent 5. 7\% of our National Health Expenditure in the United States.},

In a detailed case study of headache remedies we find that more informed consumers are less likely to pay extra to buy national brands, with pharmacists choosing them over store brands only 9 percent of the time, compared to 26 percent of the time for the average consumer. In a similar case study of pantry staples such as salt and sugar, we show that chefs devote 12 percentage points less of their purchases to national brands than demographically similar non-chefs. We extend our analysis to cover 50 retail health categories and 241 food and drink categories. The results suggest that misinformation explains a sizable share of the brand premium for health products, and a much smaller share for most food and drink products. We tie our estimates together using a stylized model of demand and pricing under misinformation.},

\textemdash{}The prevalence and costs of chronic conditions as a whole have rarely been estimated. Because the number of persons with limitations due to chronic conditions is more regularly reported in the literature, the total prevalence of chronic conditions has perhaps been minimized. The majority of persons with chronic conditions are not disabled, nor are they elderly. Chronic conditions affect all ages. Because persons with chronic conditions have greater health needs at any age, their costs are disproportionately high.},

  abstract = {Introduction
Reducing sugar-sweetened beverage consumption through taxation is a promising public health response to the obesity epidemic in the U.S. This study quantifies the expected health and economic benefits of a national sugar-sweetened beverage excise tax of \$0.01/ounce over 10 years.
Methods
A cohort model was used to simulate the impact of the tax on BMI. Assuming ongoing implementation and effect maintenance, quality-adjusted life-years gained and disability-adjusted life-years and healthcare costs averted were estimated over the 2015\textendash{}2025 period for the 2015 U.S. population. Costs and health gains were discounted at 3\% annually. Data were analyzed in 2014.
Results
Implementing the tax nationally would cost \$51 million in the first year. The tax would reduce sugar-sweetened beverage consumption by 20\% and mean BMI by 0.16 (95\% uncertainty interval [UI]=0.06, 0.37) units among youth and 0.08 (95\% UI=0.03, 0.20) units among adults in the second year for a cost of \$3.16 (95\% UI=\$1.24, \$8.14) per BMI unit reduced. From 2015 to 2025, the policy would avert 101,000 disability-adjusted life-years (95\% UI=34,800, 249,000); gain 871,000 quality-adjusted life-years (95\% UI=342,000, 2,030,000); and result in \$23.6 billion (95\% UI=\$9.33 billion, \$54.9 billion) in healthcare cost savings. The tax would generate \$12.5 billion in annual revenue (95\% UI=\$8.92, billion, \$14.1 billion).
Conclusions
The proposed tax could substantially reduce BMI and healthcare expenditures and increase healthy life expectancy. Concerns regarding the potentially regressive tax may be addressed by reduced obesity disparities and progressive earmarking of tax revenue for health promotion.},

  abstract = {Background: The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) aims to alleviate hunger among its beneficiaries by providing benefits to purchase nutritious foods.
Objective: We conducted a comprehensive dietary analysis of low-income adults and examined differences in dietary intake between SNAP participants and nonparticipants.
Design: The study population comprised 3835 nonelderly adults with a household income $\leq$130\% of the federal poverty level from the 1999\textendash{}2008 NHANES. The National Cancer Institute method was used to estimate the distributions of usual intake for dietary outcomes. Relative differences in dietary intake by SNAP participation were estimated with adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics and household food security.
Results: Few low-income adults consumed recommended amounts of whole grains, fruit, vegetables, fish, and nuts/seeds/legumes. Conversely, many low-income adults exceeded recommended limits for processed meats, sweets, and bakery desserts and sugar-sweetened beverages. Approximately 13\textendash{}22\% of low-income adults did not meet any food and nutrient guidelines; virtually no adults met all of the guidelines. Compared with nonparticipants, SNAP participants consumed 39\% fewer whole grains (95\% CI: -57\%, -15\%), 44\% more 100\% fruit juice (95\% CI: 0\%, 107\%), 56\% more potatoes (95\% CI: 18\%, 106\%), 46\% more red meat (95\% CI: 4\%, 106\%), and, in women, 61\% more sugar-sweetened beverages (95\% CI: 3\%, 152\%). SNAP participants also had lower dietary quality scores than did nonparticipants, as measured by a modified Alternate Healthy Eating Index.
Conclusion: Although the diets of all low-income adults need major improvement, SNAP participants in particular had lower-quality diets than did income-eligible nonparticipants.},

In this interpretation, cognitive and emotional processes are discrete and produced by two different systems: a cognitive and an emotional system. While cognitive biases are influences that affect rationality from within the cognitive system, emotional biases refer to those influences that affect the cognitive system from outside. Unfortunately, the assumption that rationality is a pure cognitive process is not well motivated. What I will suggest in the following is that rationality is the consequence of the intrinsic and inseparable interaction between cognition and emotions rather than the result of an independent cognitive process influenced by the latter. As a matter of fact, this is the general understanding of rationality that many scientists vindicate. If that is true, the claim has important consequences for our understanding of both rationality and emotional biases.},

To analyze their impact on the public policy we propose a very simple two-agent partial equilibrium model in the technological context of externalities. In a static framework, the centralized solution always implies an optimal policy, which may consist of taxation or subsidization depending on the individual optimum and on the technology parameters. In a dynamic model with local knowledge of the efficiency function and instantaneous output adjustments, such an optimal policy can be structurally stable or unstable. In the latter case, under small changes of the parameters the policy may switch from low taxation/subsidization to high taxation/subsidization or vice versa, or even jump discontinuously from taxation to subsidization or vice versa. Furthermore, the decentralized solution based upon "tradable rights" can be economically equivalent to the centralized solution in the form of taxation policy but the two solutions may be not politically equivalent.

The advantages of a good research design are perhaps most easily apparent in research using random assignment. We begin with an overview of Leamer's 1983 critique and his proposed remedies. We then turn to the key factors we see contributing to improved empirical work, including the availability of more and better data, along with advances in theoretical econometric understanding, but especially the fact that research design has moved front and center in much of empirical micro. We offer a brief digression into macroeconomics and industrial organization, where progress--by our lights--is less dramatic, although there is work in both fields that we find encouraging. Finally, we discuss the view that the design pendulum has swung too far. Critics of design-driven studies argue that in pursuit of clean and credible research designs, researchers seek good answers instead of good questions. We briefly respond to this concern, which worries us little.},

Using single and multigroup interrupted time series models, I examined the effect of an April 2009 increase in SNAP benefits on inpatient Medicaid cost and use patterns. I analyzed monthly Medicaid discharge data from 2006 to 2012 collected by the Massachusetts Center for Health Information and Analysis.Results. Inpatient costs for the overall Massachusetts Medicaid population grew by 0.55 percentage points per month (P\,$<$\,.001) before the SNAP increase. After the increase, cost growth fell by 73\% to 0.15 percentage points per month (\textendash{}0.40; P\,=\,.003). Compared with the overall Medicaid population, cost growth for people with the selected chronic illnesses was significantly greater before the SNAP increase, as was the decline in growth afterward. Reduced hospital admissions after the SNAP increase drove the cost declines.Conclusions. Medicaid cost growth fell in Massachusetts after SNAP benefits increased, especially for people with chronic illnesses with high sensitivity to food insecurity.},

  abstract = {Objectives: This secondary analysis identifies and describes the impact of self-reported barriers between purchasing produce at farmers markets and consuming that produce at home. This analysis also compares demographic characteristics between participants who did report barriers to fruit and vegetable consumption and those who did not. Finally, we examine differences in self-reported fruit and vegetable shopping behaviors and consumption between participants who did or did not report barriers, and compare these to the USDA 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Study design: This is a secondary analysis of data collected during an evaluation of the 2013 Fresh Bucks Program, a fruit and vegetable incentive program available at Seattle farmers markets. The original evaluation collected data from a convenience sample of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants who chose to participate in the Fresh Bucks Program. The Fresh Bucks evaluation surveyed participants at three time points: 1) before they shopped, 2) after they shopped on the same day, and 3) one-to-two months later by phone. Our analysis used data collected from all three of the surveys. Methods: These three surveys asked questions related to the purchase, preparation, and consumption of fruits and vegetables. For this analysis, we divided participants into those who reported barriers to fruit and vegetable consumption and those who did not. Differences between the two groups were assessed with student-t and Fisher's exact tests. Barriers and solutions reported by participants were categorized and reported by themes. Results: Of 70 participants, 35 did not report barriers and 35 did report at least one barrier. The most common barriers to full consumption of all produce were purchasing too much produce at once and that the produce spoiled before it could be eaten. Sixty-nine respondents indicated that they consumed more than half or all of their produce, and there was no statistically significant difference in full consumption of all produce those who reported some barriers and those who did not report barriers. The group that did not report barriers reported a significantly greater number of children per household (p=0.02), and were more likely to report that they knew how to prepare all items they purchased (p$<$0.01). Both groups were comprised predominately of white, non-Hispanic, English-speaking females from households of an average of 3 persons. The majority of both groups appear to meet the USDA 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans for daily vegetable consumption, though less so for fruit. Conclusions: The majority of participants were able to consume most of the produce purchased, and met national guidelines for vegetable consumption. The population represented in this analysis is much different from typical SNAP shoppers in demographic and other characteristics. Future incentive programs should target locations where SNAP participants who do not consume enough fruits and vegetables typically shop. Future research should further understanding of the magnitude of the major barriers reported in our analysis: purchasing more produce than can be eaten before it spoils, and the rapid spoilage of produce.},

It also examines the extent to which obesity imposes negative externalities, and economic interventions that could potentially internalize such externalities, such as food taxes, subsidies for school-based physical activity programs, and financial rewards for weight loss. It discusses other economic rationales for government intervention with respect to obesity, such as imperfect information, time inconsistent preferences, and irrational behavior. It concludes by proposing a research agenda for the field.

Overall, the evidence suggests that there is no single dominant economic cause of obesity; a wide variety of factors may contribute a modest amount to the risk. There is consistent evidence regarding the economic consequences of obesity, which are lower wages and higher medical care costs that impose negative externalities through health insurance. Studies of economic approaches to preventing obesity, such as menu labeling, taxes on energy-dense foods, and financial rewards for weight loss find only modest effects on weight and thus a range of policies may be necessary to have a substantial effect on the prevalence of obesity.},

  title = {Chapter 26 {{Tax}} Incidence},
  volume = {4},
  abstract = {This chapter reviews the concepts, methods, and results of studies that analyze the incidence of taxes. The purpose of such studies is to determine how the burden of a particular tax is allocated among consumers through higher product prices, workers through a lower wage rate, or other factors of production through lower rates of return to those factors. The methods might involve simple partial equilibrium models, analytical general equilibrium models, or computable general equilibrium models.

In a partial equilibrium model, the burden of a tax is shown to depend on the elasticity of supply relative to the elasticity of demand. Partial equilibrium models also are used to consider cases with imperfect competition.

In a two-sector general equilibrium model, a tax might be imposed on either commodity, on either factor of production, or on a factor used in one sector. The original use of this model is to analyze the corporate income tax as a tax on capital used only in one sector, the corporate sector. The model can be used to show when the burden falls only on capital or when the burden is shared with labor. The model also has been applied to the property tax, and results of the model have been used to calculate the overall burden on each income group.

Because the total stock of capital is fixed in that model, however, dynamic models are required to show how a tax on capital affects capital accumulation, future wage rates, and overall burdens. Such models might also provide analytical results or computational results. The most elaborate recent models calculate the lifetime incidence of each group. Finally, the chapter reviews the use of such incidence methods and results in the policy process.},

Design: Ecological study of 21 developed countries. Countries: Countries were eligible for inclusion if they were among the top 50 countries with the highest gross national income per capita by purchasing power parity in 2002, had a population over 3 million, and had available data on income inequality and outcome measures. Main outcome measures: Percentage of obese (body mass index $>$30) adult men and women, diabetes mortality rates, and calorie consumption per capita per day. Results: Adjusting for gross national per capita income, income inequality was positively correlated with the percentage of obese men (r=0.48, p=0.03), the percentage of obese women (r=0.62, p=0.003), diabetes mortality rates per 1 million people (r=0.46, p=0.04), and average calories per capita per day (r=0.50, p=0.02). Correlations were stronger if analyses were weighted for population size. The effect of income inequality on female obesity was independent of average calorie intake. Conclusions: Obesity, diabetes mortality, and calorie consumption were associated with income inequality in developed countries. Increased nutritional problems may be a consequence of the psychosocial impact of living in a more hierarchical society.},

  abstract = {Purpose
Soft drink consumption has been linked with higher energy intake, obesity, and poorer health. Fiscal pricing policies such as soda taxes may lower soda consumption and, in turn, reduce weight among U.S. adolescents.
Methods
This study used multivariate linear regression analyses to examine the associations between state-level grocery store and vending machine soda taxes and adolescent body mass index (BMI). We used repeated cross-sections of individual-level data on adolescents drawn from the Monitoring the Future surveys combined with state-level tax data and local area contextual measures for the years 1997 through 2006.
Results
The results showed no statistically significant associations between state-level soda taxes and adolescent BMI. Only a weak economic and statistically significant effect was found between vending machine soda tax rates and BMI among teens at risk for overweight.
Conclusions
Current state-level tax rates are not found to be significantly associated with adolescent weight outcomes. It is likely that taxes would need to be raised substantially to detect significant associations between taxes and adolescent weight.},

We offer an illustration of how one can take into account the uncertainty related to both demand estimation and health estimates and to produce confidence intervals for the overall health effects instead of only point estimates. Taxation of sugar could lead to a statistically significant reduction in both the incidence of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. The health effects appear to be most pronounced for low-income individuals, and the reforms may therefore reduce health inequality. This effect undermines the traditional regressivity argument against the heavy taxation of unhealthy food.},

Then, they discuss how matching is often undertaken in practice, offering an overview of the most prominent data analysis routines. With four hypothetical examples, they demonstrate how the assumptions behind matching estimators often break down in practice. Even so, the authors argue that matching techniques can be used effectively to strengthen the prosecution of causal questions in sociology.},

We develop a theoretical framework for applied welfare analysis that accommodates salience effects and other optimization failures.

  abstract = {This paper analyses the quantitative effects of using economic instruments in health policy on the basis of price elasticities calculated from estimated demand systems. The nutritional effects of various taxation schemes are compared for households in different age groups and social classes. Focusing on the consumption of saturated fats, fibre and sugar; it is generally found that the impact of price instruments is stronger for lower social classes than in other groups of the population. With regard to age groups, it is mostly the youngest that decrease their demand for saturated fat in response to price changes, while it is mostly the middle-aged who exhibit price responsiveness in their demand for sugar. These groups are however not considered as key target groups for dietary regulation; thus tax instruments may be effective in improving diets on average, but the design of the instruments and the targeting of vulnerable groups with special needs should be done with care. It should be noted that a tax on a single nutrient or food may have undesired effects on the demand for other food components, though this may be avoided by introducing taxes/subsidies on several food products simultaneously.},

  doi = {10.18553/jmcp.2016.22.2.102},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: U.S. health care spending nearly doubled in the decade from 2000-2010. Although the pace of increase has moderated recently, the rate of growth of health care costs is expected to be higher than the growth in the economy for the near future. Previous studies have estimated that 5\% of patients account for half of all health care costs, while the top 1\% of spenders account for over 27\% of costs. The distribution of health care expenditures by type of service and the prevalence of particular health conditions for these patients is not clear, and is likely to differ from the overall population. OBJECTIVE: To examine health care spending patterns and what contributes to costs for the top 5\% of managed health care users based on total expenditures. METHODS: This retrospective observational study employed a large administrative claims database analysis of health care claims of managed care enrollees across the full age and care spectrum. Direct health care expenditures were compared during calendar year 2011 by place of service (outpatient, inpatient, and pharmacy), payer type (commercially insured, Medicare Advantage, and Medicaid managed care), and therapy area between the full population and high resource patients (HRP). RESULTS: The mean total expenditure per HRP during calendar year 2011 was \$43,104 versus \$3,955 per patient for the full population. Treatment of back disorders and osteoarthritis contributed the largest share of expenditures in both HRP and the full study population, while chronic renal failure, heart disease, and some oncology treatments accounted for disproportionately higher expenditures in HRP. The share of overall expenditures attributed to inpatient services was significantly higher for HRP (40.0\%) compared with the full population (24.6\%), while the share of expenditures attributed to pharmacy (HRP = 18.1\%, full = 21.4\%) and outpatient services (HRP = 41.9\%, full = 54.1\%) was reduced. This pattern was observed across payer type. While the use of physician-administered pharmaceuticals was slightly higher in HRP, their use did not alter this spending pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, expenditures in the HRP population are more than 10-fold higher compared with the full population. Managed care pharmacy can benefit from understanding what contributes to these higher costs, and managed care directors should consider an appropriately balanced assessment of the share of total spend by service and therapeutic category in HRP when devising drug usage and related cost-management strategies.

The effects on vegetable purchases of either removing the value added tax on vegetables or a general income support are investigated. Adverse health effects are most serious in households consuming low quantities of vegetables. Therefore, the effects on high- and low-consuming households are estimated by using quantile regressions (QRs). Since many households did not purchase any vegetable during each survey period, censored as well as ordinary QRs are used. Our results suggest that the effects of the policy variables differ in different parts of the conditional distribution of vegetable purchases. None of the proposed policy options is likely to substantially increase vegetable purchases among low-consuming households.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the opinions of stakeholders on strategies to improve dietary quality of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants.
DESIGN: Participants answered a thirty-eight-item web-based survey assessing opinions and perceptions of SNAP and programme policy changes.
SETTING USA SUBJECTS: Survey of 522 individuals with stakeholder interest in SNAP, conducted in October through December 2011.
RESULTS: The top three barriers to improving dietary quality identified were: (i) unhealthy foods marketed in low-income communities; (ii) the high cost of healthy foods; and (iii) lifestyle challenges faced by low-income individuals. Many respondents (70 \%) also disagreed that current SNAP benefit levels were adequate to maintain a healthy diet. Stakeholders believed that vouchers, coupons or monetary incentives for purchasing healthful foods might have the greatest potential for improving the diets of SNAP participants. Many respondents (78 \%) agreed that sodas should not be eligible for purchases with SNAP benefits. More than half (55 \%) believed retailers could easily implement such restrictions. A majority of respondents (58 \%) agreed that stores should stock a minimum quantity of healthful foods in order to be certified as a SNAP retailer, and most respondents (83 \%) believed that the US Department of Agriculture should collect data on the foods purchased with SNAP benefits.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that there is broad stakeholder support for policies that align SNAP purchase eligibility with national public health goals of reducing food insecurity, improving nutrition and preventing obesity.},

  shorttitle = {Measuring {{Illegal Activity}} and the {{Effects}} of {{Regulatory Innovation}}},
  abstract = {The taxation of diesel fuel varies by use. Consumers using diesel fuel on-road must pay state and federal highway taxes while diesel fuel consumed for residential heating, industrial use, farming or off-road travel do not pay taxes. Variation in the taxation of diesel fuel creates the incentive for firms and individuals to evade on-road diesel taxes. Firms evading on-road diesel taxes purchase untaxed diesel fuel and then use or resell it for on-road use. This paper studies the incentives for tax evasion and the effects of regulatory changes meant to limit evasion of on-road diesel taxes. We propose a model of fuel tax evasion in which firms choose to purchase quantities of taxed and untaxed diesel fuel based on a heterogenous cost of evading and an endogenously set level of regulatory enforcement. In addition, we empirically study the effects of regulatory innovation in October 1993, including the addition of dye to untaxed diesel fuel, which increase the costs of evasion and lower the costs of regulatory enforcement. We estimate the effect of the regulatory changes on statelevel sales of diesel fuel and untaxed heating oil. We find that sales of diesel fuel rose 35 percent following the regulatory change while sales of untaxed heating oil fell by a similar amount. This suggests that the regulatory changes substantially limited the amount of diesel fuel tax evasion. In addition, we exploit differences in state-level on-road diesel taxes as a source of variation in the incentive for evasion. We find evidence consistent with the comparative statics of our model- the change in the sales of diesel fuel following the regulations were greater in areas with higher state on-road diesel taxes.

  title = {Why {{Surplus Consumption}} in the {{Habit Model May}} Be {{Less Persistent}} than {{You Think}}},
  abstract = {In U.S. data, value stocks have higher expected excess returns and higher CAPM alphas than growth stocks. We find the external-habit model of Campbell and Cochrane (1999) can generate a value premium in both CAPM alpha and expected excess return so long as the persistence of the log surplus-consumption ratio is not too high. In contrast, Lettau and Wachter (2007) find that when the log surplus-consumption ratio is assumed to be highly persistent as in Campbell and Cochrane, the external-habit model generates a growth premium in expected excess return. However, the micro evidence favors a less persistent log surplus-consumption ratio. We choose a value for this persistence which is sufficiently low that the most recent 2 years of log consumption contribute over 98\% of all past consumption to log habit, which is a much more reasonable number than the 25\% contribution generated by the Lettau-Wachter value. In our model, expected consumption is slowly mean-reverting, as in the long-run risk model of Bansal and Yaron (2004), which is why our model is able to generate a price-dividend ratio for aggregate equity that exhibits the high autocorrelation found in the data, despite the very low persistence of the price-of-risk state variable. Our results suggest that an external habit model in the spirit of Campbell and Cochrane can deliver an empirically sensible value premium once the persistence of the surplus consumption ratio is calibrated to the micro evidence rather than set to a value close to one. When we allow the conditional volatility of consumption growth to also be slowly mean reverting as in the long-run risk model of Bansal and Yaron, our model is also able to generate empirically sensible predictability of long-horizon returns using the price-dividend ratio, without eroding the value premium. Our results also suggest that models with fast-moving habit can deliver several empirical properties of aggregate dividend strips that have been recently documented.},

We assessed the short-term ability to increase retail prices of the first US 1-cent-per-ounce excise tax on the distribution of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), which was implemented in March 2015 by Berkeley, California., Methods. In 2014 and 2015, we examined pre- to posttax price changes of SSBs and non-SSBs in a variety of retailers in Berkeley and in the comparison cities Oakland and San Francisco, California. We examined price changes by beverage, brand, size, and retailer type., Results. For smaller beverages ($\leq$\,33.8 oz), price increases (cents/oz) in Berkeley relative to those in comparison cities were 0.69 (95\% confidence interval [CI]\,=\,0.36, 1.03) for soda, 0.47 (95\% CI\,=\,0.08, 0.87) for fruit-flavored beverages, and 0.47 (95\% CI\,=\,0.25, 0.69) for SSBs overall. For 2-liter bottles and multipacks of soda, relative price increases were 0.46 (95\% CI\,=\,0.03, 0.89) and 0.49 (95\% CI\,=\,0.21, 0.77). We observed no relative price increases for nontaxed beverages overall., Conclusions. Approximately 3 months after the tax was implemented, SSB retail prices increased more in Berkeley than in nearby cities, marking a step in the causal pathway between the tax and reduced SSB consumption.},

Using econometric models of repeated cross-sectional data on diabetes and nutritional components of food from 175 countries, we found that every 150 kcal/person/day increase in sugar availability (about one can of soda/day) was associated with increased diabetes prevalence by 1.1\% (p $<$0.001) after testing for potential selection biases and controlling for other food types (including fibers, meats, fruits, oils, cereals), total calories, overweight and obesity, period-effects, and several socioeconomic variables such as aging, urbanization and income. No other food types yielded significant individual associations with diabetes prevalence after controlling for obesity and other confounders. The impact of sugar on diabetes was independent of sedentary behavior and alcohol use, and the effect was modified but not confounded by obesity or overweight. Duration and degree of sugar exposure correlated significantly with diabetes prevalence in a dose-dependent manner, while declines in sugar exposure correlated with significant subsequent declines in diabetes rates independently of other socioeconomic, dietary and obesity prevalence changes. Differences in sugar availability statistically explain variations in diabetes prevalence rates at a population level that are not explained by physical activity, overweight or obesity.},

Caloric restriction in overweight persons produces larger weight losses than does exercise, although more of the weight loss by dieting is from lean body mass. The addition of exercise to diet intervention produces more weight loss than does dieting alone. Exercise has a favorable effect on body fat distribution, with a reduction in waist-to-hip ratio with increased exercise. Exercise is especially important in maintaining weight loss in overweight persons. Several prospective studies have shown that overweight men and women who are active and fit have lower rates of morbidity and mortality than overweight persons who are sedentary and unfit. Therefore, exercise is of benefit to overweight persons, even if it does not make them lean. Exercise is recommended as an important part of a weight control program.},

We derive numerical theory results characterizing the properties of the nested fixed point algorithm used to evaluate the objective function of BLP's estimator. We discuss problems with typical implementations, including cases that can lead to incorrect parameter estimates. As a solution, we recast estimation as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints, which can be faster and which avoids the numerical issues associated with nested inner loops. The advantages are even more pronounced for forward-looking demand models where the Bellman equation must also be solved repeatedly. Several Monte Carlo and real-data experiments support our numerical concerns about the nested fixed point approach and the advantages of constrained optimization. For static BLP, the constrained optimization approach can be as much as ten to forty times faster for large-dimensional problems with many markets.},

  abstract = {American metropolitan areas have experienced rising residential segregation by income since 1970. One potential explanation for this change is growing income inequality. However, measures of residential sorting are typically mechanically related to the income distribution, making it difficult to identify the impact of inequality on residential choice. This paper presents a measure of residential segregation by income, the Centile Gap Index (CGI), which is based on income percentiles. Using the CGI, I find that a one standard deviation increase in income inequality raises residential income segregation by 0.4-0.9 standard deviations. Inequality at the top of the distribution is associated with more segregation of the rich, while inequality at the bottom and declines in labor demand for less-skilled men are associated with residential isolation of the poor. Inequality can fully explain the rise in income segregation between 1970 and 2000.},

As one-third of elderly Food Stamp recipients are currently diabetic, greater coordination between the Food Stamp, Medicare, and Medicaid programs may improve health outcomes for this group.},

MAPCM is stated on a generic passenger assignment equilibrium model, on a generalized traffic assignment model, and on a nested logit distribution as demand model which explicitly takes into account the choice of mode of transport and transfer node among modal networks. This model is formulated as a variational inequality problem in the space of the hyperpath flows and then solved by the disaggregate simplicial decomposition (DSD) algorithm.

Illustrations of the model and of the numerical approach are reported on two test networks with asymmetric cost functions.},

A team including registered dietitians, a food scientist and programmers developed a batch-mode ingredient matching and linear programming (LP) approach to estimate the amount of each ingredient needed in a given product to produce a nutrient profile similar to that reported on its nutrition facts label (NFL). Added sugar content was estimated for 7021 products available in 2007\textendash{}08 that contain sugar from ten beverage categories. Of these, flavored waters had the lowest added sugar amounts (4.3 g/100 g), while sweetened dairy and dairy alternative beverages had the smallest percentage of added sugars (65.6\% of total sugars; 33.8\% of calories). Estimation validity was determined by comparing LP estimated values to NFL values, as well as in a small validation study. LP estimates appeared reasonable compared to NFL values for calories, carbohydrates and total sugars, and performed well in the validation test; however, further work is needed to obtain more definitive conclusions on the accuracy of added sugar estimates in CPGs. As nutrition labeling regulations evolve, this approach can be adapted to test for potential product-specific, category-level, and population-level implications.},

  abstract = {Variation in state cigarette taxes provides incentives for tax avoidance through smuggling, legal border crossing to low tax jurisdictions, or Internet purchasing. When taxes rise, tax paid sales of cigarettes will decline both because consumption will decrease and because tax avoidance will increase. The key innovation of this paper is to compare cigarette sales data to cigarette consumption data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). I show that after subtracting percent changes in consumption, residual percent changes in sales are associated with state cigarette tax changes implying the existence of tax avoidance. I estimate that the tax avoidance response to tax changes is at least twice the consumption response and that tax avoidance accounted for up to 9.6\% of sales between 1985 and 2001. Because of the increase in tax avoidance, tax paid sales data understate the level of smoking and overstate the drop in smoking. I also find that the level of legal border crossing was very low relative to other forms of tax avoidance. If states have strong preferences for smoking control, they must pair high cigarette taxes with effective policies to curb smuggling and other forms of tax avoidance or employ alternative policies such as counter-advertising and smoking restrictions.},

Isocaloric daily diets fulfilling both palatability and nutritional constraints were modeled in linear programming, using different cost constraint levels. For each modeled diet, total departure from an observed French population's average food group pattern (``mean observed diet'') was minimized.
To achieve the nutritional recommendations without a cost constraint, the modeled diet provided more energy from fish, fresh fruits and green vegetables and less energy from animal fats and cheese than the ``mean observed diet.'' Introducing and strengthening a cost constraint decreased the energy provided by meat, fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, vegetable fat, and yogurts and increased the energy from processed meat, eggs, offal, and milk. For the lowest cost diet (ie, \texteuro{}3.18/d), marked changes from the ``mean observed diet'' were required, including a marked reduction in the amount of energy from fresh fruits (-85\%) and green vegetables (-70\%), and an increase in the amount of energy from nuts, dried fruits, roots, legumes, and fruit juices.
Nutrition education for low-income French women must emphasize these affordable food choices.},

  abstract = {Background
Previous research indicates that few Americans meet the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines for fruit and vegetable consumption, and that adequate fruit and vegetable consumption may decrease the risk for chronic disease.
Methods
Twenty-four-hour dietary recall data from NHANES III, 1988\textendash{}1994 (n=14,997) and NHANES 1999\textendash{}2002 (n=8910) were used to assess adult (equal to or more than 18 years) trends in daily fruit and vegetable consumption (number of servings and types).
Results
In 1988\textendash{}1994, an estimated 27\% of adults met the USDA guidelines for fruit (equal to or more than two servings) and 35\% met the guidelines for vegetables (equal to or more than three servings). In 1999\textendash{}2002, 28\% and 32\% of adults met fruit and vegetable guidelines, respectively. There was a significant decrease in vegetable consumption over time (p=0.026). Only 11\% met USDA guidelines for both fruits and vegetables in 1988\textendash{}1994 and 1999\textendash{}2002, indicating no change in consumption (p=0.963). In both data sets, non-Hispanic blacks were less likely to meet USDA guidelines compared to non-Hispanic whites (p$<$0.05). Higher income and greater education were significantly associated with meeting the guidelines in both data sets (p$<$0.05).
Conclusions
Despite the initiation of a national fruit and vegetable campaign in 1991, the findings indicated that Americans' fruit and vegetable consumption did not increase in 1999\textendash{}2002, and only a small proportion met the related dietary recommendations. Greater public health efforts and approaches are needed to promote healthy eating in the United States.},

  abstract = {We compared sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB), alcohol, and other caloric beverage (juice and milk) consumption of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants with that of low-income nonparticipants. We used 1 day of dietary intake data from the 2005-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for 4594 adults aged 20 years and older with household income at or below 250\% of the federal poverty line. We used bivariate and multivariate methods to compare the probability of consuming and the amount of calories consumed for each beverage type across 3 groups: current SNAP participants, former participants, and nonparticipants. We used instrumental variable methods to control for unobservable differences in participant groups. After controlling for observable characteristics, SNAP participants were no more likely to consume SSBs than were nonparticipants. Instrumental variable estimates showed that current participants consumed fewer calories from SSBs than did similar nonparticipants. We found no differences in alcoholic beverage consumption, which cannot be purchased with SNAP benefits. SNAP participants are not unique in their consumption of SSBs or alcoholic beverages. Purchase restrictions may have little effect on SSB consumption.},

A comparison of stochastic and deterministic traffic assignment over congested networks. Transportation Res. B. 15 (1), 53\textendash{}64; Sheffi, Y., Powell, W.B., 1982. An algorithm, for the equilibrium assignment problem with random link Times. Networks 12 (2), 191\textendash{}207.]. Hereby, the problems with overlapping routes that occur in many public transport models can be avoided. The probit-based model with modifications similar to the principles in Nielsen [Nielsen, O.A., 1996. Do stochastic traffic assignment models consider differences in road users utility functions? Twentyfourth European Transport Forum (PTRC Annual Meeting). London, UK, Seminar M.] is used as a starting point. This makes it possible to describe passengers' different preferences towards different sub-modes and against transfers. This also considers dependencies of choices through chains of sub-modes. The simulation of perceived travel times is extended to describe differences in the distribution of travel- and waiting times for different sub-modes. Parallel lines are frequency aggregated in order to handle waiting times appropriately.

Initial tests on a full-scale case show that the methodology can describe route choices in public transport very well. This is both due to the model's ability to describe overlapping routes and due to the many different coefficients, error components and distributions that make it possible to calibrate the model. In practice, the many parameters might also be the main weakness, since this complicates the calibration. At the end of the paper, proposals to coefficients are presented based on a Danish SP-analysis. This demonstrated the applicability of the method.},

  abstract = {We consider estimation of general modern moment-condition problems in econometrics in a data-rich environment where there may be many more control variables available than there are observations. The framework allows for a continuum of target parameters and for Lasso-type or Post-Lasso type methods to be used as estimators of a continuum of high-dimensional nuisance functions. As an important leading example of this environment, we first provide results on estimation and inference for relevant treatment effects, such as local average and quantile treatment effects. The setting is designed expressly to handle many control variables, endogenous receipt of treatment, heterogeneous treatment effects, and function-valued outcomes. An approximate sparsity condition permits estimation and inference to proceed after data-driven selection of control variables. We provide conditions under which post-selection inference is uniformly valid across a wide-range of models and show that a key condition underlying the uniform validity of post-selection inference allowing for imperfect model selection is the use of orthogonal moment conditions. We apply the methods to estimate the effect of 401(k) participation on accumulated assets. We also generalize the results from the treatment effects setting to accommodate more general moment condition models. We establish functional central limit theorems for the continuum of target parameters and for the multiplier bootstrap that holds uniformly over dgps. We propose a notion of the functional delta method that allows us to derive approximate distributions for smooth functionals of a continuum of target parameters and to establish the validity of the multiplier bootstrap for approximating these distributions uniformly over dgps. We also establish rate results for continua of Lasso type estimators for continua of regression functions.},

  abstract = {Objective
To evaluate whether sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, a significant source of dietary fructose, is associated with higher serum uric acid levels and blood pressure in adolescents.
Study design
We analyzed cross-sectional data from 4867 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2004. Dietary data were assessed from 24-hour dietary recall interviews. Sugar-sweetened beverages included fruit drinks, sports drinks, soda, and sweetened coffee or tea. We used multivariate linear regression to evaluate the association of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption with serum uric acid and with blood pressure.
Results
Adolescents who drank more sugar-sweetened beverages tended to be older and male. In the adjusted model, serum uric acid increased by 0.18 mg/dL and systolic blood pressure z-score increased by 0.17 from the lowest to the highest category of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption (P for trend, .01 and .03, respectively).
Conclusions
These results from a nationally representative sample of US adolescents indicate that higher sugar-sweetened beverage consumption is associated with higher serum uric acid levels and systolic blood pressure, which may lead to downstream adverse health outcomes.},

For example, neglecting this relationship between tastes and agro-climatic endowments overstates the short-run nutritional gains from agricultural trade liberalization, since preferred foods rise in price in every region.

We then develop a simple framework that allows us to characterize analytically how within-group income inequality affects consumption inequality in a world in which agents can trade a full set of contingent consumption claims, subject to endogenous constraints emanating from the limited enforcement of intertemporal contracts. Finally, we quantitatively evaluate, in the context of a calibrated general equilibrium production economy, whether this set-up, or alternatively a standard incomplete markets model, can account for the documented stylized consumption inequality facts from the U.S. data.},

Design Keyword and reference searches were conducted in five electronic databases: Cochrane Library, EconLit, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Web of Science. Studies were included based on the following criteria: (i) intervention: field experiments; (ii) population: adolescents 12\textendash{}17 years old or adults 18 years and older; (iii) design: randomized controlled trials, cohort studies or pre\textendash{}post studies; (iv) subsidy: price discounts or vouchers for healthier foods; (v) outcome: food purchases or consumption; (vi) period: 1990\textendash{}2012; and (vii) language: English. Twenty-four articles on twenty distinct experiments were included with study quality assessed using predefined methodological criteria. Setting Interventions were conducted in seven countries: the USA (n 14), Canada (n 1), France (n 1), Germany (n 1), Netherlands (n 1), South Africa (n 1) and the UK (n 1). Subsidies applied to different types of foods such as fruits, vegetables and low-fat snacks sold in supermarkets, cafeterias, vending machines, farmers' markets or restaurants. Subjects Interventions enrolled various population subgroups such as school/university students, metropolitan transit workers and low-income women. Results All but one study found subsidies on healthier foods to significantly increase the purchase and consumption of promoted products. Study limitations include small and convenience samples, short intervention and follow-up duration, and lack of cost-effectiveness and overall diet assessment. Conclusions Subsidizing healthier foods tends to be effective in modifying dietary behaviour. Future studies should examine its long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness at the population level and its impact on overall diet intake.},

Capping added-sugar emissions into the food supply by food manufacturers at a rate of 1\% per year would be expected to reduce the prevalence of obesity by 1.7 percentage points (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.9, 2.4; a 4.6\% decline) and the incidence of type 2 diabetes by 21.7 cases per 100 000 people (95\% CI = 12.9, 30.6; a 4.2\% decline) over 20 years, averting approximately \$9.7 billion in health care spending. Racial and ethnic minorities would be expected to experience the largest declines. By comparison, equivalent price penalties through excise taxes would be expected to generate smaller health benefits. A cap-and-trade policy to reduce added-sugar intake may reduce obesity and type 2 diabetes to a greater extent than currently-proposed excise taxes.},

The main result is that the Pigovian principle holds in a modified form in the latter case as well. The problem of the distributional impact of taxation is also studied for the special case of individuals with identical preferences and a utilitarian social welfare function.},

  abstract = {A recent "revisionist" literature characterizes the pronounced rise in U.S. wage inequality since 1980 as an "episodic" event of the first half of the 1980s driven by nonmarket factors (particularly a falling real minimum wage) and concludes that continued increases in wage inequality since the late 1980s substantially reflect the mechanical confounding effects of changes in labor force composition. Analyzing data from the Current Population Survey for 1963 to 2005, we find limited support for these claims. The slowing of the growth of overall wage inequality in the 1990s hides a divergence in the paths of upper-tail (90/50) inequality--which has increased steadily since 1980, even adjusting for changes in labor force composition--and lower-tail (50/10) inequality, which rose sharply in the first half of the 1980s and plateaued or contracted thereafter. Fluctuations in the real minimum wage are not a plausible explanation for these trends since the bulk of inequality growth occurs above the median of the wage distribution. Models emphasizing rapid secular growth in the relative demand for skills--attributable to skill-biased technical change--and a sharp deceleration in the relative supply of college workers in the 1980s do an excellent job of capturing the evolution of the college/high school wage premium over four decades. But these models also imply a puzzling deceleration in relative demand growth for college workers in the early 1990s, also visible in a recent "polarization" of skill demands in which employment has expanded in high-wage and low-wage work at the expense of middle-wage jobs. These patterns are potentially reconciled by a modified version of the skill-biased technical change hypothesis that emphasizes the role of information technology in complementing abstract (high-education) tasks and substituting for routine (middle-education) tasks.},

African-American women who were pregnant and enrolling in WIC in Washington, DC (n=71), and Charlotte, NC (n=108), participated in the study. Surveys were completed in May and June 2007 measuring farmers' market use, barriers to farmers' market use, previous Farmers' Market Nutrition Program participation, previous redemption of Farmers' Market Nutrition Program vouchers, and dietary consumption. Women in Washington, DC, might have previously participated in the Farmers' Market Nutrition Program, while women in Charlotte had no previous Farmers' Market Nutrition Program participation. Analyses included descriptive, $\chi$2 statistic, analysis of variance, and unadjusted and multiple logistic regression. Participants' average age was 24 years, average education was 12.2 years, and average daily fruit/vegetable consumption was 7.5 servings. Participants in Charlotte and Washington, DC, without previous Farmers' Market Nutrition Program participation had similar farmers' market use rates (32.4\% and 40\%, respectively); those with previous Farmers' Market Nutrition Program participation in Washington, DC, had higher farmers' market use rates (61\%) (P=0.006). Previous participation in the Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (odds ratio [OR]: 3.30; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.57 to 6.93), previous redemption of Farmers' Market Nutrition Program vouchers (OR: 4.96; CI: 2.15 to 11.45), and higher fruit/vegetable consumption (OR: 2.59; CI: 1.31 to 5.12) were associated with farmers' market use. Controlling for city, women who previously redeemed Farmers' Market Nutrition Program vouchers were more likely to use a farmers' market (OR: 6.90; CI: 1.54 to 31.00). Commonly reported barriers were lack of farmers' markets close to home and lack of transportation to farmers' markets. Women who received and redeemed Farmers' Market Nutrition Program vouchers were much more likely to purchase fruits/vegetables at farmers' markets. Future research to explore barriers and incentives for farmers' market use among WIC participants in urban and rural settings is warranted.},

This article provides an empirical examination of sales tax base choice on the part of states using a political economy framework and tools of spatial econometrics. The analysis accommodates tax competition among states, using a variety of alternative definitions of "competitors." The authors find little evidence that consumer exemptions are linked to needy segments of the population, while equipment exemptions are more common in states with large industrial sectors. The results also show that the nature of the interstate tax competition process differs for different elements of the base and that nongeographic competition can be especially important.},

Throughout the chapter, the general results are also specialized to common econometric estimators (e.g. MLE and GMM), and in specific examples we work through the conditions for the various results in detail. The results are also extended to two-step estimators (with finite-dimensional parameter estimation in the first step), estimators derived from nonsmooth objective functions, and semiparametric two-step estimators (with nonparametric estimation of an infinite-dimensional parameter in the first step). Finally, the trinity of test statistics is considered within the quite general setting of GMM estimation, and numerous examples are given.},

Overall, the percentage of New York City adults who reported consuming no fruits and vegetables in the previous day decreased slightly over a 10-year period (2002: 14.3\% [95\% confidence interval = 13.4\%, 15.2\%]; 2012: 12.5\% [95\% confidence interval = 11.4\%, 13.6\%]; P for trend $<$ .001).

We then estimate a large utility-derived demand system over this joint product-nutrient space that allows us to calculate price and expenditure elasticities. Using our structural demand estimates, we simulate the role of product taxes on soda, sugar-sweetened beverages, packaged meals, and snacks, and nutrient taxes on fat, salt, and sugar. We find that a 20\% nutrient tax has a significantly larger impact on nutrition than an equivalent product tax, due to the fact that these are broader-based taxes. However, the costs of these taxes in terms of consumer utility are not higher. A sugar tax in particular is a powerful tool to induce healthier nutritive bundles among consumers.},

  abstract = {Computers are now involved in many economic transactions and can capture data associated with these transactions, which can then be manipulated and analyzed. Conventional statistical and econometric techniques such as regression often work well, but there are issues unique to big datasets that may require different tools. First, the sheer size of the data involved may require more powerful data manipulation tools. Second, we may have more potential predictors than appropriate for estimation, so we need to do some kind of variable selection. Third, large datasets may allow for more flexible relationships than simple linear models. Machine learning techniques such as decision trees, support vector machines, neural nets, deep learning, and so on may allow for more effective ways to model complex relationships. In this essay, I will describe a few of these tools for manipulating and analyzing big data. I believe that these methods have a lot to offer and should be more widely known and used by economists.},

  title = {Consumer Valuation of Health Attributes in Food},
  abstract = {In modern societies it seems that the pleasures of taste often encourage the consumption of fatty, salty and sweet foods, whereas growing health awareness discourages consumption of the same foods. Numerous studies find that education and diet healthiness are highly correlated and one possible explanation is that consumers with a longer education are better at understanding and appreciating the health implication of their diet than are consumers with a short education. In this study we estimate a hedonic model of consumer's valuation of food characteristics that allows nutrients to influence utility both through their perceived effects on health and their effects on the taste of food. The model is estimated using purchase data from a consumer panel with comprehensive coverage of food purchases for 2500 Danish households. We find that it is differences in taste valuations, rather than differences in valuation of health effects, that explains the observed differences in dietary healthiness across consumers with different educational backgrounds.},

  abstract = {Poor dietary patterns and obesity, established risk factors for chronic disease, have been linked to neighborhood deprivation, neighborhood minority composition, and low area population density. Neighborhood differences in access to food may have an important influence on these relationships and health disparities in the U.S. This article reviews research relating to the presence, nature, and implications of neighborhood differences in access to food.
A snowball strategy was used to identify relevant research studies (n=54) completed in the U.S. and published between 1985 and April 2008.
Research suggests that neighborhood residents who have better access to supermarkets and limited access to convenience stores tend to have healthier diets and lower levels of obesity. Results from studies examining the accessibility of restaurants are less consistent, but there is some evidence to suggest that residents with limited access to fast-food restaurants have healthier diets and lower levels of obesity. National and local studies across the U.S. suggest that residents of low-income, minority, and rural neighborhoods are most often affected by poor access to supermarkets and healthful food. In contrast, the availability of fast-food restaurants and energy-dense foods has been found to be greater in lower-income and minority neighborhoods.
Neighborhood disparities in access to food are of great concern because of their potential to influence dietary intake and obesity. Additional research is needed to address various limitations of current studies, identify effective policy actions, and evaluate intervention strategies designed to promote more equitable access to healthy foods.},

@article{rider_essays_2013,
  title = {Essays in {{Applied Economics}}},
  abstract = {In this dissertation, I investigate the relationship between unemployment and grocery purchasing patterns with a particular focus on the health impacts of recession. The first chapter, I analyze food items and in the second chapter, I turn the focus on beer and cigarettes. Both of these chapters investigate possible mechanisms behind the documented phenomenon of decreased morbidity and mortality during recessions.To conduct the analysis presented in Chapter 1, I supplement five years of multi-market, multi-chain grocery scanner data with additional information on the positive health attributes of food products to create a unique dataset. First, I find no evidence that products with positive health attributes are systematically more expensive or promoted systematically less. They are, however, purchased on promotion less. Second, I match the scanner data with unemployment rate by market in order to conduct a reduced form analysis of changes in pricing, promotion and quantities sold given a macroeconomic shock. For overall grocery categories, prices go down, promotions weakly increase and overall quantities sold decline; results vary for products with health attributes. While shares for healthy products within category are unaffected by recession in some categories, in other categories I see a marked shift toward higher fat options within category.In Chapter 2, I again use retail scanner data to track price and quantity changes for beer and cigarettes subject to changes in unemployment rate. First, I find prices paid do not change significantly as a function of unemployment rate. Next, I find that the percentage of beer and cigarettes purchased on promotion is not significantly related to unemployment rate per se; that said, there is evidence of a period of experimentation with in-store cigarette promotions following the Tobacco Master Agreement that coincided with the 2001 recession and led to more cigarettes being purchased on promotion overall during that period. However, this period of strong in-store promotions gave way to fewer overall purchases made on promotion as states strengthened tobacco regulations in the early 2000's. The quantity of beer sold in supermarkets, which accounts for about 40 percent of total beer sales, and drug stores seems mostly unchanged by recessionary conditions; however, cigarette quantity sold has a modest negative relationship with unemployment. Taken as a whole, this work suggests that average grocery purchasing patterns do not change greatly due to increases in average unemployment rate. While not entirely inconsistent with the hypothesis that decreased morbidity and mortality during recessions may be due to decreased smoking rates or better eating habits, the small magnitude of the overall effect suggests other mechanisms or heterogeneous effects might be at play.},

To assess the importance of the obesity epidemic on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, we determined the prevalence of obesity and the relationship of obesity to CVD risk factors and subclinical vascular disease.Methods
The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis is an observational cohort study involving 6814 persons aged 45 to 84 years who were free of clinical CVD at baseline (2000-2002). The study assessed the association between body size and CVD risk factors, medication use, and subclinical vascular disease (coronary artery calcium, carotid artery intimal medial thickness, and left ventricular mass).Results
A large proportion of white, African American, and Hispanic participants were overweight (60\% to 85\%) and obese (30\% to 50\%), while fewer Chinese American participants were overweight (33\%) or obese (5\%). Hypertension and diabetes were more prevalent in obese participants despite a much higher use of antihypertensive and/or antidiabetic medications. Obesity was associated with a greater risk of coronary artery calcium (17\%), internal carotid artery intimal medial thickness greater than 80th percentile (32\%), common carotid artery intimal medial thickness greater than 80th percentile (45\%), and left ventricular mass greater than 80th percentile (2.7-fold greater) compared with normal body size. These associations persisted after adjustment for traditional CVD risk factors.Conclusions
These data confirm the epidemic of obesity in most but not all racial and ethnic groups. The observed low prevalence of obesity in Chinese American participants indicates that high rates of obesity should not be considered inevitable. These findings may be viewed as indicators of potential future increases in vascular disease burden and health care costs associated with the obesity epidemic.},

Understanding the recent patterns and trends in beverage intake and sales in Mexico provides both background and baseline data for the importance of SSBs and other beverages in the Mexican diet. We analyzed a single 24-h dietary recall from 2 nationally representative surveys: the Mexican Nutrition Survey 1999 (n = 6049) and the National Health and Nutrition Survey 2012 (n = 10,343). To describe trends and patterns in beverages, we calculated the volume and energy intake per capita and per consumer and the proportion of consumers of each beverage group in each survey. A commercial sales dataset was used to describe beverage sales trends from 1999 to 2012. From 1999 to 2012, total daily energy from beverages increased among children aged 5\textendash{}11 y (+45.3 kcal), females aged 12\textendash{}19 y (+57.3 kcal), and adult females aged 20\textendash{}49 y (+96.4 kcal) (P $<$ 0.05). Over the same period, intake of beverages with added sugars increased, specifically flavored milk, agua fresca (fruit water made in stalls or at home, usually with added sugars), and fruit drinks among children aged 5\textendash{}11 y and females aged 12\textendash{}19 y and caloric coffee/tea, soda, and agua fresca among adult females aged 20\textendash{}49 y. In 2012, beverages represented 17.5\% (325 kcal) and 19.0\% (382 kcal) of the total daily energy intake per capita in children aged 1\textendash{}19 y and adults aged $\geq$20 y, respectively. In 2012, flavored milk beverages, caloric soda, and high-fat milk were the top 3 major contributors to total daily energy intake per capita in all children aged 1\textendash{}19 y. Caloric soda, caloric coffee/tea, and agua fresca were the top 3 major energy contributors in adults aged $\geq$20 y. From 1999 to 2012, sales of soda, fruit-flavored drinks, and flavored waters increased. In conclusion, consumption of several beverages with added sugars increased among children and adult females in Mexico. Because caloric soda is currently 1 of the top beverages consumed, a 10\% tax on SSBs might help to significantly reduce added sugars intake in Mexico.},

The relationship between income and life expectancy is well established but remains poorly understood.Objectives
To measure the level, time trend, and geographic variability in the association between income and life expectancy and to identify factors related to small area variation.Design and Setting
Income data for the US population were obtained from 1.4 billion deidentified tax records between 1999 and 2014. Mortality data were obtained from Social Security Administration death records. These data were used to estimate race- and ethnicity-adjusted life expectancy at 40 years of age by household income percentile, sex, and geographic area, and to evaluate factors associated with differences in life expectancy.Exposure
Pretax household earnings as a measure of income.Main Outcomes and Measures
Relationship between income and life expectancy; trends in life expectancy by income group; geographic variation in life expectancy levels and trends by income group; and factors associated with differences in life expectancy across areas.Results
The sample consisted of 1 408 287 218 person-year observations for individuals aged 40 to 76 years (mean age, 53.0 years; median household earnings among working individuals, \$61 175 per year). There were 4 114 380 deaths among men (mortality rate, 596.3 per 100 000) and 2 694 808 deaths among women (mortality rate, 375.1 per 100 000). The analysis yielded 4 results. First, higher income was associated with greater longevity throughout the income distribution. The gap in life expectancy between the richest 1\% and poorest 1\% of individuals was 14.6 years (95\% CI, 14.4 to 14.8 years) for men and 10.1 years (95\% CI, 9.9 to 10.3 years) for women. Second, inequality in life expectancy increased over time. Between 2001 and 2014, life expectancy increased by 2.34 years for men and 2.91 years for women in the top 5\% of the income distribution, but by only 0.32 years for men and 0.04 years for women in the bottom 5\% (P\,$<$\,.001 for the differences for both sexes). Third, life expectancy for low-income individuals varied substantially across local areas. In the bottom income quartile, life expectancy differed by approximately 4.5 years between areas with the highest and lowest longevity. Changes in life expectancy between 2001 and 2014 ranged from gains of more than 4 years to losses of more than 2 years across areas. Fourth, geographic differences in life expectancy for individuals in the lowest income quartile were significantly correlated with health behaviors such as smoking (r\,=\,-0.69, P\,$<$\,.001), but were not significantly correlated with access to medical care, physical environmental factors, income inequality, or labor market conditions. Life expectancy for low-income individuals was positively correlated with the local area fraction of immigrants (r\,=\,0.72, P\,$<$\,.001), fraction of college graduates (r\,=\,0.42, P\,$<$\,.001), and government expenditures (r\,=\,0.57, P\,$<$\,.001).Conclusions and Relevance
In the United States between 2001 and 2014, higher income was associated with greater longevity, and differences in life expectancy across income groups increased over time. However, the association between life expectancy and income varied substantially across areas; differences in longevity across income groups decreased in some areas and increased in others. The differences in life expectancy were correlated with health behaviors and local area characteristics.},

Epidemiologic studies have suggested that higher intake of added sugar is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Few prospective studies have examined the association of added sugar intake with CVD mortality.Objective
To examine time trends of added sugar consumption as percentage of daily calories in the United States and investigate the association of this consumption with CVD mortality.Design, Setting, and Participants
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 1988-1994 [III], 1999-2004, and 2005-2010 [n\,=\,31\,147]) for the time trend analysis and NHANES III Linked Mortality cohort (1988-2006 [n\,=\,11\,733]), a prospective cohort of a nationally representative sample of US adults for the association study.Main Outcomes and Measures
Cardiovascular disease mortality.Results
Among US adults, the adjusted mean percentage of daily calories from added sugar increased from 15.7\% (95\% CI, 15.0\%-16.4\%) in 1988-1994 to 16.8\% (16.0\%-17.7\%; P\,=\,.02) in 1999-2004 and decreased to 14.9\% (14.2\%-15.5\%; P\,$<$\,.001) in 2005-2010. Most adults consumed 10\% or more of calories from added sugar (71.4\%) and approximately 10\% consumed 25\% or more in 2005-2010. During a median follow-up period of 14.6 years, we documented 831 CVD deaths during 163\,039 person-years. Age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity\textendash{}adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of CVD mortality across quintiles of the percentage of daily calories consumed from added sugar were 1.00 (reference), 1.09 (95\% CI, 1.05-1.13), 1.23 (1.12-1.34), 1.49 (1.24-1.78), and 2.43 (1.63-3.62; P\,$<$\,.001), respectively. After additional adjustment for sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics, HRs were 1.00 (reference), 1.07 (1.02-1.12), 1.18 (1.06-1.31), 1.38 (1.11-1.70), and 2.03 (1.26-3.27; P\,=\,.004), respectively. Adjusted HRs were 1.30 (95\% CI, 1.09-1.55) and 2.75 (1.40-5.42; P\,=\,.004), respectively, comparing participants who consumed 10.0\% to 24.9\% or 25.0\% or more calories from added sugar with those who consumed less than 10.0\% of calories from added sugar. These findings were largely consistent across age group, sex, race/ethnicity (except among non-Hispanic blacks), educational attainment, physical activity, health eating index, and body mass index.Conclusions and Relevance
Most US adults consume more added sugar than is recommended for a healthy diet. We observed a significant relationship between added sugar consumption and increased risk for CVD mortality.},

More frequent cooking at home may help improve diet quality and be associated with food values, particularly for individuals participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
Objective
To examine patterns of fruit and vegetable consumption and food values among adults (aged 20 and older) in the United States, by SNAP participation and household cooking frequency.
Methods
Analysis of cross-sectional 24-hour dietary recall data obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007\textendash{}2010 (N = 9560).
Results
A lower percentage of SNAP participants consumed fruit (total: 35\% vs. 46\%, p = 0.001; fresh: 30\% vs. 41\%, p \&lt; 0.001) and vegetables (total: 49\% vs. 58\%, p = 0.004; fresh: 35\% vs. 47\%, p \&lt; 0.001) than those ineligible for SNAP. Among SNAP participants, cooking \&gt; 6 times/week was associated with greater vegetable consumption compared to cooking \&lt; 2 times/week (175 g vs. 98 g, p = 0.003). SNAP-eligible individuals who cooked $\geq$ 2 times/week were more to report price (medium cookers: 47\% vs. 33\%, p = 0.001; high cookers: 52\% vs. 40\%, p \&lt; 0.001), ease of preparation (medium cookers: 36\% vs. 28\%, p = 0.002; high cookers: 36\% vs. 24\%, p \&lt; 0.001) and how long food keeps (medium cookers: 57\% vs. 45\%, p \&lt; 0.001; high cookers: 61\% vs. 50\%, p \&lt; 0.001) as important compared to SNAP-ineligible individuals.
Conclusions
Fruit and vegetable consumption in the United States is low regardless of cooking frequency. Efforts to improve diet quality should consider values on which food purchases are based.},

We develop an extension of the standard formula for the optimal Pigouvian corrective tax to incorporate the possibility that consumers avoid the tax by making purchases in nearby lower tax jurisdictions. To provide a key parameter for our formula, we estimate a structural endogenous switching regression model of border-crossing and cigarette prices. In illustrative calculations, we find that for many states, after taking into account tax avoidance the optimal tax is at least 20\% smaller than the standard Pigouvian tax that simply internalizes external costs. Our empirical estimate that tax avoidance strongly responds to the price differential is the main reason for this result. We also use our results to examine the benefits of replacing avoidable state excise taxes with a harder-to-avoid federal excise tax on cigarettes.},

This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets.

  shorttitle = {Committing to {{Exercise}}},
  abstract = {Sedentary lifestyles, obesity, and obesity-related chronic diseases have become increasingly common among U.S. adults, posing a major health policy challenge. While individuals may be interested in exercising more to reduce these health risks, they often have difficultly forming long-term exercise habits. Behavioral economic devices like commitment contracts aid individuals make repeated actions in situations where there are upfront costs and the benefits, though substantial, are delayed. It is not known whether such contracts can help individuals to sustain increased exercise. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to test whether nudges and anchoring could be used to shift the types of exercise commitment contracts people entered into using a web-based contract creation tool. At the time of contract creation, users selected a contract length (duration); number of times a week to exercise (frequency); and a financial penalty for failing to live up to the contract in a given week (stake). We randomly set the default duration shown to users (8 weeks, 12 weeks, or 16 weeks). Outcomes include: contract acceptance; chosen duration, frequency, total exercise sessions; and chosen financial stake. We analyzed the data using multivariable regressions and also developed a theoretical model of active choice in the context of nudges, fitting the model to the data using non-linear optimization. 619 users, age 18-69, were included in the study, of whom 61\% accepted/signed an exercise commitment contract. Users who were shown a longer default contract durations were significantly more likely to choose a contract of longer duration. There was no difference in the likelihood of accepting contracts or in the chosen exercise frequency or financial stakes. Our model of active choice suggested that almost 50\% of users were highly susceptible to default values for contract duration, with the greatest effect for users interested in exercise contracts with durations nearer to the nudged defaults. This implication of the model was confirmed by quantile regressions (greatest effect of nudges for contract durations between the 40th and 80th percentiles). With changes in default values, individuals can be nudged into longer exercise commitment contracts that obligate them to greater numbers of exercise sessions.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.tra.2016.02.004},
  abstract = {Online predictions of bus arrival times have the potential to reduce the uncertainty associated with bus operations. By better anticipating future conditions, online predictions can reduce perceived and actual passenger travel times as well as facilitate more proactive decision making by service providers. Even though considerable research efforts were devoted to the development of computationally expensive bus arrival prediction schemes, real-world real-time information (RTI) systems are typically based on very simple prediction rules. This paper narrows down the gap between the state-of-the-art and the state-of-the-practice in generating RTI for public transport systems by evaluating the added-value of schemes that integrate instantaneous data and dwell time predictions. The evaluation considers static information and a commonly deployed scheme as a benchmark. The RTI generation algorithms were applied and analyzed for a trunk bus network in Stockholm, Sweden. The schemes are assessed and compared based on their accuracy, reliability, robustness and potential waiting time savings. The impact of RTI on passengers waiting times are compared with those attained by service frequency and regularity improvements. A method which incorporates information on downstream travel conditions outperforms the commonly deployed scheme, leading to a 25\% reduction in the mean absolute error. Furthermore, the incorporation of instantaneous travel times improves the prediction accuracy and reliability, and contributes to more robust predictions. The potential waiting time gains associated with the prediction scheme are equivalent to the gains expected when introducing a 60\% increase in service frequency, and are not attainable by service regularity improvements.},

We provide evidence of an interaction effect between time preference and food prices, with cheaper food leading to the largest weight gains among those exhibiting the most impatience. The interaction of changing economic incentives with heterogeneous discounting may help explain why increases in BMI have been concentrated amongst the distribution's right tail. We also model time-inconsistent preferences by computing individuals' quasi-hyperbolic discounting parameters. Both long-run patience and present-bias predict BMI, suggesting obesity is partly attributable to both rational intertemporal tradeoffs and time inconsistency.},

Models are estimated using restricted-use data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey for 2000\textendash{}2005. The IV model, which exploits genetic variation in weight as a natural experiment, yields estimates of the impact of obesity on medical costs that are considerably higher than the estimates reported in the previous literature. For example, obesity is associated with \$656 higher annual medical care costs, but the IV results indicate that obesity raises annual medical costs by \$2741 (in 2005 dollars). These results imply that the previous literature has underestimated the medical costs of obesity, resulting in underestimates of the economic rationale for government intervention to reduce obesity-related externalities.},

This study assesses its effectiveness in a range of settings. Methods\hspace{0.6em} Systematic review of peer reviewed intervention trials and grey literature evaluation reports of child malnutrition programs using the Positive Deviance/Hearth approach. Results\hspace{0.6em} Ten peer reviewed studies and 14 grey literature reports met the inclusion criteria. These described results for 17 unique Positive Deviance/Hearth programs in 12 countries. Nine programs used a pre- and post-test design without a control, which limited the conclusions that could be drawn. Eight used more robust designs such as non-randomized trials, non-randomized cross-sectional sibling studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Of the eight programs that reported nutritional outcomes, five reported some type of positive result in terms of nutritional status \textendash{} although the improvement was not always as large as predicted, or across the entire target population. Both the two RCTs demonstrated improvements in carer feeding practices. Qualitative results unanimously reported high levels of satisfaction from participants and recipient communities. Conclusions\hspace{0.6em} Overall this study shows mixed results in terms of program effectiveness, although some Positive Deviance/Hearth programs have clearly been successful in particular settings. Sibling studies suggest that the Positive Deviance/Hearth approach may have a role in preventing malnutrition, not just rehabilitation. Further research is needed using more robust study designs and larger sample sizes. Issues related to community participation and consistency in reporting results need to be addressed.},

  abstract = {SummaryBackground \&amp; aims
To consider the hypothesis that addiction to food, or more specifically sucrose, plays a role in obesity and eating disorders.
Methods
By considering the relevant literature a series of predictions were examined, derived from the hypothesis that addiction to sucrose consumption can develop. Fasting should increase food cravings, predominantly for sweet items; cravings should occur after an overnight fast; the obese should find sweetness particularly attractive; a high-sugar consumption should predispose to obesity. More specifically predictions based on the hypothesis that addiction to sugar is central to bingeing disorders were developed. Dieting should predate the development of bingeing; dietary style rather than psychological, social and economic factors should be predispose to eating disorders; sweet items should be preferentially consumed while bingeing; opioid antagonists should cause withdrawal symptoms; bingeing should develop at a younger age when there is a greater preference for sweetness.
Results
The above predications have in common that on no occasion was the behaviour predicted by an animal model of sucrose addiction supported by human studies.
Conclusion
There is no support from the human literature for the hypothesis that sucrose may be physically addictive or that addiction to sugar plays a role in eating disorders.},

We used a log linear version of the Paasche's index with lagged shares as the price index in an Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) model and modified the intercept of a standard AIDS model to account for effects of the season and the lagged demand. Own-price, cross-price, and expenditure elasticities vary across species considerably, which highlights the importance of studying consumer demand behavior at disaggregated levels for seafood.},

There is no indication that simple sugars differ from complex sugars in this regard. Epidemiologic data show a clear inverse relation between intake of sugar and fat. Further, although high intake of dietary fat is positively associated with indexes of obesity, high intake of sugar is negatively associated with indexes of obesity. There is ample reason to associate high-fat diets with obesity but, at present, no reason to associate high-sugar diets with obesity.},

  abstract = {While the tobacco industry ranks among the most substantial and successful of economic enterprises, tobacco consumption is associated with more deaths than any other product. Economic analysis of the markets for tobacco products, particularly cigarettes, has contributed considerable insight to debates about the importance of the industry and the appropriate roles of public policy in grappling with the health consequences of tobacco. Certainly the most significant example of this phenomenon has been the rapidly expanding and increasingly sophisticated body of research on the effects of price increases on cigarette consumption. Because excise tax comprises an important component of price, the resultant literature has played a prominent role in legislative debates about using taxation as a principal tool to discourage smoking. In addition to informing legislative debates, this literature has contributed both theory and empirical evidence to the growing interest in modeling the demand for addictive products.

This chapter examines this body of research in detail, as well as a variety of equity and efficiency concerns accompanying debates about cigarette taxation. Coverage also includes economic analysis of the role of other tobacco control policies, such as restrictions on advertising, of special interest due to their prominence in debates about tobacco control. The chapter concludes with consideration of research addressing the validity of the tobacco industry's argument that its contributions to employment, tax revenues, and trade balances are vital to the economic health of states and nations. This argument is one of the industry's principal weapons in its battle against policy measures intended to reduce tobacco product consumption.},

  abstract = {The obesity epidemic and excessive consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages have led to proposals of economics-based interventions to promote healthy eating in the United States. Targeted food and beverage taxes and subsidies are prominent examples of such potential intervention strategies. This paper examines the differential effects that taxing sugar-sweetened beverages by calories and by ounces have on beverage demand. To properly measure the extent of substitution and complementarity between beverage products, we developed a fully modified distance metric model of differentiated product demand that endogenizes the cross-price effects. We illustrated the proposed methodology in a linear approximate almost ideal demand system, although other flexible demand systems can also be used. In the empirical application using supermarket scanner data, the product-level demand model consists of 178 beverage products with a combined market share of over 90\%. The novel demand model outperformed the conventional distance metric model in non-nested model comparison tests, and in terms of the economic significance of model predictions. In the fully modified model, a calorie-based beverage tax was estimated to cost \$1.40 less in compensating variation than an ounce-based tax per 3,500 beverage calories reduced. This difference in welfare cost estimates between two tax strategies is more than three times the difference estimated by the conventional distance metric model. If applied to products purchased from all sources, a 0.04-cent per kcal tax on sugar-sweetened beverages is predicted to reduce annual per capita beverage intake by 5,800 kcal.},

Several methods, which include support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), k nearest neighbours algorithm (k-NN) and linear regression (LR), are adopted for the bus arrival time prediction. Observation surveys are conducted to collect bus running and arrival time data for validation of the proposed models. The results show that the proposed models are more accurate than the models based on the bus running times of single route. Moreover, it is found that the SVM model performs the best among the four proposed models for predicting the bus arrival times at bus stop with multiple routes.},

  doi = {10.1186/1475-2891-13-1},
  abstract = {Background
While farmers' markets are a potential strategy to increase access to fruits and vegetables in rural areas, more information is needed regarding use of farmers' markets among rural residents. Thus, this study's purpose was to examine (1) socio-demographic characteristics of participants; (2) barriers and facilitators to farmers' market shopping in southern rural communities; and (3) associations between farmers' market use with fruit and vegetable consumption and body mass index (BMI).

Methods
Cross-sectional surveys were conducted with a purposive sample of farmers' market customers and a representative sample of primary household food shoppers in eastern North Carolina (NC) and the Appalachian region of Kentucky (KY). Customers were interviewed using an intercept survey instrument at farmers' markets. Representative samples of primary food shoppers were identified via random digit dial (RDD) cellular phone and landline methods in counties that had at least one farmers' market. All questionnaires assessed socio-demographic characteristics, food shopping patterns, barriers to and facilitators of farmers' market shopping, fruit and vegetable consumption and self-reported height and weight. The main outcome measures were fruit and vegetable consumption and BMI. Descriptive statistics were used to examine socio-demographic characteristics, food shopping patterns, and barriers and facilitators to farmers' market shopping. Linear regression analyses were used to examine associations between farmers' market use with fruit and vegetable consumption and BMI, controlling for age, race, education, and gender.

Results
Among farmers' market customers, 44\% and 55\% (NC and KY customers, respectively) reported shopping at a farmers' market at least weekly, compared to 16\% and 18\% of NC and KY RDD respondents. Frequently reported barriers to farmers' market shopping were market days and hours, ``only come when I need something'', extreme weather, and market location. Among the KY farmers' market customers and NC and KY RDD respondents, fruit and vegetable consumption was positively associated with use of farmers' markets. There were no associations between use of farmers' markets and BMI.

Conclusions
Fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with farmers' market shopping. Thus, farmers' markets may be a viable method to increase population-level produce consumption.},

Economic interventions like taxes can shift the relative prices of unhealthy foods to nudge consumers towards healthier options. Beverages with added sugar are a good starting point for food taxation; they constitute over 10 percent of caloric intake nationwide and provide little or no nutritional value. Current levels of taxation on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are too low to affect consumer behavior, but the implementation of a penny-per-ounce excise tax could lead to substantial public health benefits. Current estimates predict that a tax that raised the cost of SSBs by 20 percent could lead to an average reduction of 3.8 pounds per year for adults, causing the prevalence of obesity to decline from 33 to 30 percent. SSB taxes would also generate considerable revenue for public health and obesity prevention programs. Although the beverage industry is fighting such taxes with massive lobbying and public relations campaigns, support for the policies is increasing, especially when revenue is earmarked for obesity prevention.},

The study adopts a state-level panel data series spanning the period 2002 through 2007, which is the most recent panel for which data for all of the variables are available. Consistent with a number of previous studies, the PLS estimates in this study find that the higher the cigarette excise tax, the lower the aggregate volume of cigarettes consumed. Of course, this outcome does not address the practical problem of the substitution of high nicotine cigarettes for low nicotine cigarettes in the presence of a significant cigarette tax hike. This circumstance leads to the second objective of this study, namely, to propose a general template for a different kind of cigarette excise tax, one that is tied directly to each cigarette brand's nicotine and tar content.},

During the past two decades, the prevalence of obesity in children has risen greatly worldwide. Obesity in childhood causes a wide range of serious complications, and increases the risk of premature illness and death later in life, raising public-health concerns. Results of research have provided new insights into the physiological basis of bodyweight regulation. However, treatment for childhood obesity remains largely ineffective. In view of its rapid development in genetically stable populations, the childhood obesity epidemic can be primarily attributed to adverse environmental factors for which straightforward, if politically difficult, solutions exist.},

Part of the discussion has centered on the potential of `fat taxes' and/or the subsidization of the purchase of fresh fruits and vegetables to coax consumers to better diets. Whether this discussion has merit or not, fundamental to the debate are the demand elasticities of the commodities involved. This study employs weekly data from several retail stores on fruit prices and sales to estimate elasticities of individual fruits. Estimates show consumers are more responsive to price than has been found previously.},

  abstract = {We examine the relationship between the business cycle and poverty for the period from 1960 to 2008 using income data from the Current Population Survey and consumption data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey. This new evidence on the relationship between macroeconomic conditions and poverty is of particular interest given recent changes in anti-poverty policies that have placed greater emphasis on participation in the labor market and in-kind transfers. We look beyond official poverty, examining alternative income poverty and consumption poverty, which have conceptual and empirical advantages as measures of the well-being of the poor. We find that both income and consumption poverty are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. A one percentage point increase in unemployment is associated with an increase in the after-tax income poverty rate of 0.9 to 1.1 percentage points in the long-run, and an increase in the consumption poverty rate of 0.3 to 1.2 percentage points in the long-run. The evidence on whether income is more responsive to the business cycle than consumption is mixed. Income poverty does appear to be more responsive using national level variation, but consumption poverty is often more responsive to unemployment when using regional variation. Low percentiles of both income and consumption are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, and in most cases low percentiles of income appear to be more responsive than low percentiles of consumption.},

  abstract = {Unreliability in public transport means that actual departure and arrival times may deviate from the official timetable. Data on unreliability are usually unimodal. In this article we address unreliability from a multimodal perspective, implying a shift of attention away from the supplier towards the customer. Estimates of unreliability of public transport chains in Netherlands are provided. In addition, customer valuation of unreliability is estimated. We find that the valuation of a certain travel time loss of 1 min is 27 cents, whereas the valuation of a 50\% probability of a 2 min delay is 64 cents. This implies a strong attitude of risk aversion towards travel time of passengers. On the basis of these values an evaluation of probability enhancing strategies has been carried out. We conclude that among the most promising means of improving the overall quality of the chains is that travellers use the bicycle as an entrance or exit mode. Other measures which are relatively inexpensive to implement and result in fairly large gains for the average public transport passenger, are an increase in transfer times and a strict constraint on bus drivers to prevent them from departing early.},

  abstract = {As the largest federal food assistance program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) has potential to improve food choices among low-income populations. The program's impact on youth is important because they are represented in more than half of all SNAP households. This study estimates the impact of participation in SNAP, also known as the Food Stamp Program, on the frequency of soft drink, 100\% fruit juice, and milk consumption among youth (ages 11 through 14) in the United States. A cohort of 3,126 youth from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey who were surveyed in 2004 (5th grade) and 2007 (8th grade) were used for the analysis. Multivariate linear regression with individual fixed effects was conducted to estimate the effect of SNAP participation on the frequency of consumption of each beverage type in the preceding week. The fixed effects controlled for factors specific to the youth, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and time-invariant bias in reporting SNAP participation or beverage consumption. Overall participation in SNAP increased from 19.5\% to 20.3\% between 2004 and 2007, with 14.4\% reporting a different participation status in 2007 as compared with 2004. SNAP participation was not found to be predictive of the frequency of soft drink, 100\% fruit juice, or milk consumption among youth. In its current state, SNAP may serve to replace lost income for qualifying households, but not alter their food and beverage choices. Interventions that support access to and incentivize the consumption of more healthful foods and beverages may be successful in improving the nutritional quality of intake.},

Unobserved heterogeneity is controlled for using a correlated random effects specification and a generalized method of moments framework used to estimate the model. While relatively small differences in elasticity estimates are found between a flexible random effects specification and one that restricts the random effect coefficient to be time invariant, larger differences are observed when comparing the flexible model to a pooled cross-sectional estimator. The results suggest the limited ability of such estimators to control for preference heterogeneity and unit-value endogeneity leads to parameter bias.},

We find that differences in prices and characteristics are important and can explain some difference (e.g., United States-France difference in caloric intake) but generally cannot explain many of the compositional patterns by themselves. Instead, it seems an interaction between the economic environment and differences in preferences is needed to explain cross-country differences.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.amepre.2012.09.065},
  abstract = {Background
Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages including nondiet sodas, sport drinks, and energy drinks has been linked with obesity. Recent state and local efforts to tax these beverages have been unsuccessful. Enactment will be unlikely without public support, yet little research is available to assess how to effectively make the case for such taxes.
Purpose
The objectives were to assess public opinion about arguments used commonly in tax debates regarding sugar-sweetened beverages and to assess differences in public opinion by respondents' political party affiliation.
Methods
A public opinion survey was fielded in January\textendash{}March 2011 using a probability-based sample of respondents from a large, nationally representative online panel to examine public attitudes about nine pro- and eight anti-tax arguments. These data were analyzed in August 2011.
Results
Findings indicated greater public agreement with anti- than pro-tax arguments. The most popular anti-tax argument was that a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages is arbitrary because it does not affect consumption of other unhealthy foods (60\%). A majority also agreed that such taxes were a quick way for politicians to fill budget holes (58\%); an unacceptable intrusion of government into people's lives (53.8\%); opposed by most Americans (53\%); and harmful to the poor (51\%). No pro-tax arguments were endorsed by a majority of the public. Respondents reported highest agreement with the argument that sugar-sweetened beverages were the single largest contributor to obesity (49\%) and would raise revenue for obesity prevention (41\%).
Conclusions
Without bolstering public support for existing pro-tax messages or developing alternative pro-tax messages, enacting such policies will be difficult. Message-framing studies could be useful in identifying promising strategies for persuading Americans that taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages are warranted.},

  abstract = {Weight loss resulting from an exercise intervention tends to be lower than predicted. Modest weight loss can arise from an increase in energy intake, physiological reductions in resting energy expenditure, an increase in lean tissue or a decrease in non-exercise activity. Lower than expected, weight loss could also arise from weak and invalidated assumptions within predictive models. To investigate these causes, we systematically reviewed studies that monitored compliance to exercise prescriptions and measured exercise-induced change in body composition. Changed body energy stores were calculated to determine the deficit between total daily energy intake and energy expenditures. This information combined with available measurements was used to critically evaluate explanations for low exercise-induced weight loss. We conclude that the small magnitude of weight loss observed from the majority of evaluated exercise interventions is primarily due to low doses of prescribed exercise energy expenditures compounded by a concomitant increase in caloric intake.},

For example, we calculate that a society of agents with the preferences and endowment process of Campbell and Cochrane (1999) would experience a welfare gain equivalent to a permanent increase of nearly 16\% in consumption, if the government enforced one month of fasting per year, reducing consumption by 10 percent then. We examine and explain these features of the preferences in detail. We numerically characterize the solution to the social planning problem. We conclude that Campbell-Cochrance preferences will provide for interesting macroeconomic modeling challenges, when endogenizing aggregate consumption choices and government policy.},

  abstract = {Data with a large number of variables relative to the sample size\textemdash"high-dimensional data"\textemdash{}are readily available and increasingly common in empirical economics. High-dimensional data arise through a combination of two phenomena. First, the data may be inherently high dimensional in that many different characteristics per observation are available. For example, the US Census collects information on hundreds of individual characteristics and scanner datasets record transaction-level data for households across a wide range of products. Second, even when the number of available variables is relatively small, researchers rarely know the exact functional form with which the small number of variables enter the model of interest. Researchers are thus faced with a large set of potential variables formed by different ways of interacting and transforming the underlying variables. This paper provides an overview of how innovations in "data mining" can be adapted and modified to provide high-quality inference about model parameters. Note that we use the term "data mining" in a modern sense which denotes a principled search for "true" predictive power that guards against false discovery and overfitting, does not erroneously equate in-sample fit to out-of-sample predictive ability, and accurately accounts for using the same data to examine many different hypotheses or models.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.jhealeco.2007.05.005},
  abstract = {Virtually all social science research related to obesity studies a person's body mass index (BMI). Yet there is wide agreement in the medical literature that BMI is seriously flawed because it does not distinguish fat from fat-free mass such as muscle and bone. This paper studies data that include multiple measures of fatness and finds that many important patterns, such as who is classified as obese, group rates of obesity, and correlations of obesity with social science outcomes, are all sensitive to the measure of fatness and obesity used.
We show that, relative to percent body fat, BMI misclassifies substantial fractions of individuals as obese or non-obese; in general, BMI is less accurate classifying men than women. Furthermore, when percent body fat instead of BMI is used to define obesity, the gap in obesity between white and African American men increases substantially but the gap in obesity between African American and white women is cut in half. Finally, total body fat is negatively correlated with employment for some groups and fat-free mass is not significantly correlated with employment for any group, a difference that was obscured in previous research that studied BMI.
In the long run, social science datasets should include more accurate measures of fatness. In the short run, estimating more accurate measures of fatness using height and weight is not possible except by making unattractive assumptions, but there is also no reason to adhere uncritically to BMI as a measure of fatness. Social science research on obesity would be enriched by greater consideration of alternate specifications of weight and height and more accurate measures of fatness.},

The results for the postwar period suggest that retail prices rise by approximately the amount of the sales tax, in contrast to other studies that reveal tax overshifting. For the Depression period, clothing prices appear to rise by only 2/3 of the amount of sales taxes. This finding accords with earlier evidence based on retailer surveys in the interwar period.},

Many prior studies have shown that general equilibrium interactions affect excess burden but have not appreciated the bias associated with ignoring these interactions or the quantitative importance of this bias. We derive an implementable alternative to the simple formula. This alternative formula captures interactions that the simple formula omits; as a result it is both unbiased and usually more accurate.},

Our approach is to model outcomes and participation simultaneously, using exogenous variation in state eligibility to identify SNAP participation. We use this approach for both ordered choices (health) and count outcomes (sickdays, office-based visits, outpatient visits), where the former uses maximum likelihood and the latter maximum simulated likelihood. In addition, we control for state-level unobservables that are correlated with both participation and health, which previous studies of this question have neglected. Our results indicate that SNAP has an consistently positive effect on SAH; it significantly increases the probability of reporting excellent or very good health. We also find that SNAP participants spend about 3 fewer days in bed due to illness each year, and report between 1 and 2 fewer office-based doctor visits and a fraction fewer outpatient visits. Supplementary specifications indicate that, although SNAP participants consume fewer office visits overall, they have more checkups than comparable non-participants.},

  title = {Multinomial {{Inverse Regression}} for {{Text Analysis}}},
  abstract = {Text data, including speeches, stories, and other document forms, are often connected to sentiment variables that are of interest for research in marketing, economics, and elsewhere. It is also very high dimensional and difficult to incorporate into statistical analyses. This article introduces a straightforward framework of sentiment-preserving dimension reduction for text data. Multinomial inverse regression is introduced as a general tool for simplifying predictor sets that can be represented as draws from a multinomial distribution, and we show that logistic regression of phrase counts onto document annotations can be used to obtain low dimension document representations that are rich in sentiment information. To facilitate this modeling, a novel estimation technique is developed for multinomial logistic regression with very high-dimension response. In particular, independent Laplace priors with unknown variance are assigned to each regression coefficient, and we detail an efficient routine for maximization of the joint posterior over coefficients and their prior scale. This "gamma-lasso" scheme yields stable and effective estimation for general high-dimension logistic regression, and we argue that it will be superior to current methods in many settings. Guidelines for prior specification are provided, algorithm convergence is detailed, and estimator properties are outlined from the perspective of the literature on non-concave likelihood penalization. Related work on sentiment analysis from statistics, econometrics, and machine learning is surveyed and connected. Finally, the methods are applied in two detailed examples and we provide out-of-sample prediction studies to illustrate their effectiveness.},

  title = {Demand {{Estimation}} with {{Machine Learning}} and {{Model Combination}}},
  abstract = {We survey and apply several techniques from the statistical and computer science literature to the problem of demand estimation. We derive novel asymptotic properties for several of these models. To improve out-of-sample prediction accuracy and obtain parametric rates of convergence, we propose a method of combining the underlying models via linear regression. Our method has several appealing features: it is robust to a large number of potentially-collinear regressors; it scales easily to very large data sets; the machine learning methods combine model selection and estimation; and the method can flexibly approximate arbitrary non-linear functions, even when the set of regressors is high dimensional and we also allow for fixed effects. We illustrate our method using a standard scanner panel data set to estimate promotional lift and find that our estimates are considerably more accurate in out of sample predictions of demand than some commonly used alternatives. While demand estimation is our motivating application, these methods are likely to be useful in other microeconometric problems.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a model of consumer demand that is consistent with the observed expenditure patterns of individual consumers in a long time series of expenditure surveys and is also able to provide a detailed welfare analysis of shifts in relative prices. A nonparametric analysis of consumer expenditure patterns suggests that Engel curves require quadratic terms in the logarithm of expenditure. While popular models of demand such as the Translog or the Almost Ideal Demand Systems do allow flexible price responses within a theoretically coherent structure, they have expenditure share Engel curves that are linear in the logarithm of total expenditure. We derive the complete class of integrable quadratic logarithmic expenditure share systems. A specification from this class is estimated on a large pooled data set of U.K. households. Models that fail to account for Engel curvature are found to generate important distortions in the patterns of welfare losses associated with a tax increase.},

  abstract = {We consider the long-run patterns of poverty in the United States from the early 1960s to 2010. Our results contradict previous studies that have argued that poverty has shown little improvement over time or that antipoverty efforts have been ineffective. We find that moving from traditional income-based measures of poverty to a consumption-based measure and, crucially, adjusting for bias in price indexes lead to the conclusion that the poverty rate declined by 26.4 percentage points between 1960 and 2010, 8.5 percentage points of which has occurred since 1980. Our consumptionbased measure suggests considerably greater improvement than the incomebased measures for single-parent families and the elderly, but relatively less for married-parent families. Changes in tax policy explain a substantial part of the decline in poverty; Social Security has also been important, but other transfer programs have played a small role. Changes in education have also contributed, but other demographic trends have had little impact. Measurement error in income likely explains some of the most noticeable differences between changes in income poverty and in consumption poverty, but saving and dissaving appear to play a modest role for most demographic groups.},

  shorttitle = {Intake of Sugar-Sweetened Beverages and Weight Gain},
  abstract = {Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), particularly carbonated soft drinks, may be a key contributor to the epidemic of overweight and obesity, by virtue of these beverages' high added sugar content, low satiety, and incomplete compensation for total energy. Whether an association exists between SSB intake and weight gain is unclear. We searched English-language MEDLINE publications from 1966 through May 2005 for cross-sectional, prospective cohort, and experimental studies of the relation between SSBs and the risk of weight gain (ie, overweight, obesity, or both). Thirty publications (15 cross-sectional, 10 prospective, and 5 experimental) were selected on the basis of relevance and quality of design and methods. Findings from large cross-sectional studies, in conjunction with those from well-powered prospective cohort studies with long periods of follow-up, show a positive association between greater intakes of SSBs and weight gain and obesity in both children and adults. Findings from short-term feeding trials in adults also support an induction of positive energy balance and weight gain by intake of sugar-sweetened sodas, but these trials are few. A school-based intervention found significantly less soft-drink consumption and prevalence of obese and overweight children in the intervention group than in control subjects after 12 mo, and a recent 25-week randomized controlled trial in adolescents found further evidence linking SSB intake to body weight. The weight of epidemiologic and experimental evidence indicates that a greater consumption of SSBs is associated with weight gain and obesity. Although more research is needed, sufficient evidence exists for public health strategies to discourage consumption of sugary drinks as part of a healthy lifestyle.},

When market actors buy or sell things that have unfortunate consequences for others -- negative externalities -- a standard economic prescription is to raise the price of the externality-producing good. Alternatively, the bad actor can be paid to stop. For policymakers, choosing between these two options, the stick and the carrot, can be a difficult task even if people respond as expected to cash incentives. David Gamage and Darien Shanske argue that low-salience taxes can be just as effective at changing behavior if policymakers increase their price to make up for the taxes' low visibility. Carrots are not necessarily always inferior to sticks, once salience and its potential correlations are taken into account. Fully salient price instruments may not always be ideal. Government should likely adjust the prices of its taxes and subsidies at least to account for the process of learning and diffusion of information across the economy. And these adjustments may be closer to optimal if they balance revenue and other needs against the correction of externalities.},

Because there are several dimensions of eligibility, the analysis allows for specification tests, estimating any discontinuities along a given dimension of eligibility, dependent upon whether one satisfied the other two dimensions of eligibility. The paper uses a novel data collection strategy to measure subsequent college enrollment for 150,000 financial aid applicants in 1998 and 1999.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity is a serious health issue and predisposes individuals to an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Its prevalence in children has increased worldwide. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of a school-based management program based on healthy lifestyle promotion for obese and overweight adolescents in Sousse, Tunisia. METHODS: We conducted a quasi-experimental study among overweight and obese school children enrolled in 7th and 8th grades in Sousse, Tunisia with two groups, intervention and control. The 1-year intervention was based on promoting healthy eating and physical activity through a collective intervention for all recruited children and an individual intervention only for obese children who require intensive managing. Data collection was done before, at the end and at a 4-month follow up of the intervention, both in intervention and control groups. RESULTS: The body mass index Z score decreased significantly from pre-intervention to post-intervention (1.89$\pm$0.57 to 1.76$\pm$0.63, p$<$0.001) and from post-intervention to the follow-up (1.76$\pm$0.63 to 1.55$\pm$0.68, p$<$0.001) in the intervention group. In the control group, it decreased significantly from pre-intervention to post-intervention but not significantly from post-intervention to follow-up assessment. Calorie intake decreased significantly both in intervention and control groups. CONCLUSION: This project began with introducing a new culture of health management in schools on one side and with increasing awareness of the importance of obesity prevention and treatment. The support of authorities for this type of action is very important to guarantee its sustainability.},

METHODS: In 2011 we collected dietary and health information from 1372 residents in "food deserts" in Pittsburgh, PA. We audited neighborhood restaurants and food stores (n\,=\,40) including 16 distant food venues at which residents reported shopping. We assessed end-aisle displays, special floor displays, cash register displays, and price reductions for sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs); foods high in saturated oils, fats, and added sugars; and nutritious foods such as fruits, vegetables, and products with at least 51\% whole grains. RESULTS: Supermarkets and superstores had the largest numbers of displays and price reductions for low-nutrient foods. Exposure to displays of SSBs and foods high in saturated oils, fats, and added sugars and price reduction of SSBs was associated with increased body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: In-store marketing strategies of low-nutrient foods appear to be risk factors for a higher body mass index among regular shoppers. Future research is needed to confirm the causal role of marketing strategies in obesity.},

  abstract = {Micronutrient malnutrition (`Hidden Hunger') now afflicts over two billion people worldwide, resulting in poor health, low worker productivity, high rates of mortality and morbidity, increased rates of chronic diseases (coronary heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes), and permanent impairment of cognitive abilities of infants born to micronutrient-deficient mothers. The consequences of food system failures include lethargic national development efforts, continued high population growth rates, and a vicious cycle of poverty for massive numbers of underprivileged people in all nations. Our food systems are failing us globally by not providing enough balanced nutrient output to meet all the nutritional needs of every person, especially resource-poor women, infants and children in developing countries. Agriculture is partly responsible because it has never held nutrient output as an explicit goal of its production systems. Indeed, many agricultural policies have fostered a decline in nutrition and diet diversity for the poor in many countries. Nutrition and health communities are also partly responsible because they have never considered using agriculture as a primary tool in their programs directed at alleviating poor nutrition and ill health globally. Now is the time for a new paradigm for agriculture and nutrition. We must consider ways in which agriculture can contribute to finding sustainable solutions to food system failures through holistic food-based system approaches, thereby closely linking agricultural production to improving human health, livelihood and well being. Such action will stimulate support for agricultural research in many developed countries because it addresses consumer issues as well as agricultural production issues and is, therefore, politically supportable.},

In 2006, academics, and federal and state government agencies initiated efforts to design a national policy for obesity prevention. The Ministry of Health (MOH) established an expert panel to develop recommendations on beverage intake for a healthy life in 2008. Subsequently, the MOH, with support from academia, initiated the development of the National Agreement for Healthy Nutrition (ANSA). ANSA was signed by all relevant sectoral actors in 2010 and led to initiatives banning sodas and regulating unhealthy food in schools and the design of other yet to be implemented initiatives, such as a front-of-package labeling system. A main challenge of the ANSA has been the lack of harmonization between industry interests and public health objectives and effective accountability and monitoring mechanisms to assess implementation across government sectors. Bold strategies currently under consideration include taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages, improvement of norms for healthy food in schools, regulation of food and beverage marketing to children and implementation of a national front-of-pack labeling system. Strong civil society organizations have embraced the prevention of obesity as their goal and have used evidence from academia to position obesity prevention in the public debate and in the government agenda.},

However, obesity and other food-related health conditions typically occur as a result of poor diets and lifestyle, rather than poor individual product choices. As consumers, we generally have an imperfect understanding of our diet and lifestyle and use heuristics to process complex diet and lifestyle information. Increasingly, as ubiquitous computing applications in the area of food and consumption proliferate a number of questions arise about how consumers are using these technologies to assist them in processing their diet and lifestyle information. This article addresses this juncture by integrating streams of research in food consumption, information processing, and technology adoption to better understand consumer interaction with Digital Health Technologies (DHTs) to assist in information processing. As this represents a relatively new stream of research in an area of growing importance, the article develops a conceptual framework about consumer interaction with DHTs and identifies a number of pertinent questions for future research to examine.},

Particular attention is paid to the insights provided by recently published studies in the areas of marketing and consumer research, and those insights are integrated with findings from studies in nutrition and related disciplines. The review begins with an examination of the multiple ways in which 1) food pricing strategies and 2) marketing communication (including branding and food claims) bias food consumption. It then describes the effects of newer and less conspicuous marketing actions, focusing on 3) packaging (including the effects of package design and package-based claims) and 4) the eating environment (including the availability, salience, and convenience of food). Throughout, this review underscores the promising opportunities that food manufacturers and retailers have to make profitable ``win-win'' adjustments to help consumers eat better.},

In Cyprus, in 1995, WHO and FAO advocated FBDGs (Food-Based Dietary Guidelines); these allow for food cultural differences, population genetic differences, and the broad non-nutrition roles of food (such as social discourse); and, especially, the physico-chemical properties and phytochemicals which confer human biological advantages. Measures of the total cuisine (for example, of the traditionality of the Greek diet) and its transportability to other localities (such as Food Habits in Later Life and SENECA studies) in relation to health also indicate that the contribution of diet to health is more than the sum of its chemical components. Food diversity or variety (including food processing variations) is also a predictor of health outcomes and of food security. It is also relevant that for each 1\% increase in dietary diversity there is a 1\% increase in per capita food consumption for poor and middle-income countries. Food variety also reflects biodiversity and environmental security. In the future, it can be expected that the environmental costs of food production will need to be taken into account in the formulation of nutrition requirements and related policy and in food choice.},

BACKGROUND: Emotional eating is common, especially in women with obesity. A better understanding of relationships of its psychosocial correlates might benefit behavioural weight-loss treatments. DESIGN: A field-based, quantitative study incorporated two theoretically derived weight-loss treatments using repeated measures analyses that employed validated surveys. METHODS: Women with obesity volunteered for a community-based weight-loss study and were assigned to either a treatment of a manual plus phone support (n~=~47), or in-person contacts emphasizing self-regulation (n~=~48), over 6~months. Both emphasized physical activity, healthy eating and building self-efficacy for enabling the health-behaviour changes. Data were collected between 2013-2014. Multiple regression analyses assessed predictors of self-efficacy change. Mixed-model analysis of variances assessed treatment differences in psychosocial changes. Mediation analyses assessed mediation of the relationships between body satisfaction and emotional eating changes. RESULTS: Changes in Overall mood and Self-regulation significantly predicted change in Self-efficacy to control emotionally cued eating. Changes in Body satisfaction, Emotional eating, Mood, Self-regulating eating and Self-efficacy were significant overall, and each significantly greater in the in-person treatment. Self-efficacy significantly mediated the relationship between changes in Body satisfaction and Emotional eating total (and Emotional eating when depressed or anxious, but not when frustrated/angry). CONCLUSION: Results clarified mediation of the dynamic relationship between body satisfaction and emotional eating, which might enable behavioural weight-loss treatments to better-address emotional eating.},

  abstract = {The industrial agriculture system consumes fossil fuel, water, and topsoil at unsustainable rates. It contributes to numerous forms of environmental degradation, including air and water pollution, soil depletion, diminishing biodiversity, and fish die-offs. Meat production contributes disproportionately to these problems, in part because feeding grain to livestock to produce meat--instead of feeding it directly to humans--involves a large energy loss, making animal agriculture more resource intensive than other forms of food production. The proliferation of factory-style animal agriculture creates environmental and public health concerns, including pollution from the high concentration of animal wastes and the extensive use of antibiotics, which may compromise their effectiveness in medical use. At the consumption end, animal fat is implicated in many of the chronic degenerative diseases that afflict industrial and newly industrializing societies, particularly cardiovascular disease and some cancers. In terms of human health, both affluent and poor countries could benefit from policies that more equitably distribute high-protein foods. The pesticides used heavily in industrial agriculture are associated with elevated cancer risks for workers and consumers and are coming under greater scrutiny for their links to endocrine disruption and reproductive dysfunction. In this article we outline the environmental and human health problems associated with current food production practices and discuss how these systems could be made more sustainable.},

All subjects underwent ergospirometry during maximal exercise testing on treadmill and recording of body composition, electrocardiogram and clinic and ambulatory blood pressure. RESULTS: Women (n = 132) were slightly older and had higher fat mass, but lower weight, blood pressure and prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) than men (n = 109) (all p $<$ 0.05), while prevalences of obesity and hypertension did not differ. A significant interaction between sex and HR was demonstrated (p $<$ 0.05). In multivariate analysis, female sex ($\beta$ = 0.99, p $<$ 0.01) predicted higher resting HR independent of confounders. Higher resting HR was particularly associated with presence of MetS, hypertension, higher insulin resistance and lower relative muscle mass in men (all p $<$ 0.05). Female sex also predicted higher peak exercise HR ($\beta$ = 0.48, p $<$ 0.01) independent of confounders. Higher peak exercise HR was particularly associated with higher exercise capacity and lower age and self-reported physical activity in men, while lower HbA1c and absence of obesity were the main covariates in women in multivariate analyses (all p $<$ 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In our study population, obesity and obesity-associated metabolic changes influenced both resting and peak exercise HR.},

Preschoolers (N=247, mean age 4 years 8 months) created 2 meals (preferred and healthy), completed measures of verbal nutrition knowledge and vocabulary, and were weighed and measured for BMI. Parents reported healthy eating guidance, child dietary intake, and family demographics. Children used an average of 5.1 energy-dense (ED) and 3.4 nutrient-dense (ND) foods for their preferred meal, but reversed the ratio to 3.1 ED and 5.1 ND foods for their healthy meal. Healthy meals contained fewer estimated kcal, less fat, less sugar, and more fiber than preferred meals. Meal differences held for younger children, children with lower verbal nutrition knowledge and vocabulary, and child subgroups at higher risk for obesity. Placemat Protocol data correlated with parent healthy eating guidance and child obesogenic dietary intake as expected. The Placemat Protocol shows promise for assessing developing healthy-meal schemas before children can fully articulate their knowledge on verbal measures.},

RESULTS: No significant effects were found for the educational intervention, alone or with the labeling, on total fat intake and the psychosocial determinants of eating less fat. CONCLUSION: Nutrition education and labeling of low-fat food products in supermarkets did not prove to be effective strategies. The fact that the supermarket is a highly competitive environment may have accounted for this lack of effect.},

Purpose \textendash{} The purpose of this paper is to develop a comprehensive set of grocery store attributes that can be standardized and used in empirical research aiming at increasing retailers' understanding of determinants of grocery store choice, and assessing how the relative importance of the attributes is affected by consumer socio-demographic characteristics and shopping behaviour. Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} An internet survey of 1,575 Swedish consumers was conducted. A large set of attributes was rated by the participants on seven-point scales with respect to their importance for choice of grocery store. Principal component analysis (PCA) resulted in a reduced set of reliably measured aggregated attributes. This set included the attractiveness attributes price level, supply range, supply quality, service quality, storescape quality, facilities for childcare, and closeness to other stores, and the accessibility attributes easy access by car, easy access by other travel modes, and availability (closeness to store and opening hours). Findings \textendash{} The results showed that accessibility by car is the most important grocery store attribute, storescape quality and availability the next most important and facilities for childcare the least important. It was also found that socio-demographic factors and shopping behaviour have an impact on the importance of the store attributes. Originality/value \textendash{} A comprehensive set of attractiveness and accessibility attributes of grocery stores that can be standardized and used in empirical research is established. The results are valid for the Swedish-European conditions that differ from the conditions in North America where most previous research has been conducted.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Healthy lifestyles such as being physically active and eating a healthy diet help reduce the childhood obesity risk. However, population-level studies on the relationship between lifestyles and childhood obesity typically focus on either physical activity or diet but seldom both. This study examined physical activity and diet quality in relation to obesity in a nationally representative sample of U.S. children and adolescents. METHODS: The study sample of 2818 children 6-17 years old came from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006 waves. A healthy eating index (HEI)-2010 was constructed based on two nonconsecutive 24-h dietary recalls. Participants at or above the 60th percentile of the HEI-2010 score were classified as consuming a healthy diet. Participants engaging in at least 60 min of moderate-vigorous physical activity daily measured by accelerometer were classified as being physically active. Adjusted average marginal effect of diet quality and physical activity on obesity was calculated based on estimates from logistic regressions. RESULTS: Compared with those consuming a healthy diet who are physically active, the estimated probabilities for overweight and obesity were 19.03 (95\% confidence interval: 11.31, 26.74) and 15.84 (10.48, 21.21) percentage points higher among children consuming an unhealthy diet and who are physically inactive, 16.53 (7.58, 25.48) and 13.48 (5.68, 21.29) percentage points higher among children consuming a healthy diet but who are physically inactive and 3.22 (-3.43, 9.88) and 3.10 (-3.08, 9.29) percentage points higher among children consuming an unhealthy diet but physically active, respectively. CONCLUSION: Healthy habit formation at an early age is essential in obesity prevention.},

This paper provides specific information on the energy requirement for the main alternatives in each production stage, which should allow the identification of improvement options. One observation is that there seems to be a remarkable relationship between energy requirement throughout the production chain and market value. Products with a high added (emotional) value, e.g. wine, season fruits, and coffee, deviate from the abovementioned relationship. However, that deviation may be overcome when the emotional value is included in the functional unit of the food product. It is concluded that there seems to be no systematic environmental benefit for home-made over industrially produced food. For all food categories, there is a wide variety in energy requirement due to three major factors, viz. season of consumption (fresh versus import and glasshouse production), scale of preparation (home-made and industrial scale) and consumer preference (meat versus vegetable food).},

We discuss implementation issues in using choice architecture tools, including individual differences and errors in evaluation of choice outcomes. Finally, this paper presents a few applications that illustrate the positive effect choice architecture can have on real-world decisions.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Food purchased from prepared-food sources has become a major part of the American diet and is linked to increased rates of chronic disease. Many interventions targeting prepared-food sources have been initiated with the goal of promoting healthful options. The objective of this study was to provide a systematic review of interventions in prepared-food sources in community settings. METHODS: We used PubMed and Google Scholar and identified 13 interventions that met these criteria: 1) focused on prepared-food sources in public community settings, 2) used an impact evaluation, 3) had written documentation, and 4) took place after 1990. We conducted interviews with intervention staff to obtain additional information. Reviewers extracted and reported data in table format to ensure comparability. RESULTS: Interventions mostly targeted an urban population, predominantly white, in a range of income levels. The most common framework used was social marketing theory. Most interventions used a nonexperimental design. All made use of signage and menu labeling to promote healthful food options. Several promoted more healthful cooking methods; only one introduced new healthful menu options. Levels of feasibility and sustainability were high; sales results showed increased purchasing of healthful options. Measures among consumers were limited but in many cases showed improved awareness and frequency of purchase of promoted foods. CONCLUSION: Interventions in prepared-food sources show initial promising results at the store level. Future studies should focus on improved study designs, expanding intervention strategies beyond signage and assessing impact among consumers.},

Four experiments show that less favorable nutritional inferences are formed when perceived attribute variability is high as opposed to low. This effect occurs when two attributes differing in perceived variability are presented or when the attribute is held constant and perceived variability is manipulated through priming. However, this effect is reduced when a health halo label is present as opposed to absent. Furthermore, the presence of a health halo label increases the amount of a product that is actually consumed when perceived attribute variability is high (vs. low) and when consumers learn from experience. Together, the results suggest that perceived attribute variability and the health halo effect jointly influence inference and behavior.},

Successful participants were subsequently allocated to two treatment groups offered different monetary incentives for maintaining the previously achieved target weight and to a control group. This is the first experiment of this kind that finds sustainable effects of weight loss rewards on the body weight of the obese even 18 months after the rewards were removed.

  abstract = {While numerous studies have demonstrated the impact of out-of-store marketing (e.g. shopping trip goals and price promotion) and in-store marketing (e.g. shelf design) on customer buying behavior, few studies have investigated the influence of social effects on unplanned in-store purchasing. In store-social influences refer to purchase behavior arising from a recommendation or advice from a closely connected and important person to the customer. The current study conducted two focus group interviews with respect to research participants' grocery shopping experiences. The first focus group composed of 6 university staff and 8 university students were recruited for the second group. Most focus group participants are female. This is salient for the Thai cultural context whereby shopping is still considered the domain for females or housewives particularly for the university staff group. Research findings revealed that both groups mostly prepared shopping lists before going to the store. However, the list could be an unwritten note. Unplanned purchases were driven by economic value, such as discounted price and sales promotion. However it was found that an accompanying person could alter the research participant's planned buying list and even loyal brand purchases. Specifically, a customer's friend and/or relative may affect the respondent's purchasing pattern. For example, a friend or spouse or relative may give information about defects or the quality of products during in-store shopping. As a result, a customer's unplanned buying decision may be affected by social effect in terms of buying or not-buying even though the customer is motivated by purchase impulses from shelf-exposure. Based on the current research's findings, there is a need to develop the current theoretical models for the unplanned buying by including the social effect. Furthermore, logical explanations why and how social effect has an impact on unplanned in-store buying are required and resulted in relevant construct development. Social media that is an important route of social effects on in-store buying behavior should be investigated. Strategic management implication is that market practitioners are required to consider the marketing program investments on the customer's social effect for enhancing the in-store unplanned product performance.},

At the public level, providing information about why and how to choose a healthy diet has been the typical approach to encouraging behavioral change. Information can also influence food producers and marketers to develop and promote more healthful products, creating an environment in which it is easier for consumers to make healthier dietary choices. Nevertheless, information may not always be effective in improving food choices. One explanation is that nutrition information is complex and difficult to convey in a clear, actionable manner. Also, knowledge, while necessary, may not be sufficient to motivate behavior change. Even when consumers understand nutrition information, competing preferences for tastier, less expensive, or more convenient foods may lead them to make other choices. Findings from psychology, marketing, and behavioral economics research suggest approaches that may enhance the effectiveness of informational approaches and complement informational efforts. More research is needed to further develop these strategies and evaluate their effectiveness.},

Building on the hedonic-utilitarian theory, the present study examines the determinants of household retail store loyalty using national consumer panel data over a four-year period. Specifically, this study delineates two categories of retail stores: hedonic retail stores and utilitarian retail stores. We conceive of hedonic consumption as shopping for pleasure and enjoyment, whereas utilitarian consumption occurs when consumers wish to fulfill a specific need or task. Our findings reveal that household store loyalty does in fact exhibit meaningful differences between hedonic retail stores vs. utilitarian retail stores. We offer potential strategies for both hedonic and utilitarian retail stores.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Environments that facilitate energy-dense, nutrient-poor diets are associated with childhood obesity. We examined the effect of a change of school environment on the prevalence of obesity and related dietary behavior in early adolescence. METHODS: Fifteen schools in Victoria, Australia, were recruited at random from the bottom 2 strata of a 5-level socioeconomic scale. In 9 schools, students in grade 6 primary school transitioned to different schools for grade 7 secondary school, whereas in 6 schools, students remained in the same school from grade 6 to grade 7. Time 1 measures were collected from students (N = 245) in grade 6 (aged 11-13 y). Time 2 data were collected from 243 (99\%) of the original cohort in grade 7. Data collected were dietary recall self-reported by students via questionnaire, measured height and weight of students, and aspects of the school food environment via school staff survey. Comparative and mixed model regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Of 243 students, 63\% (n = 152) changed schools from time 1 to time 2, with no significant difference in weight status. Students who changed schools reported an increase in purchases of after-school snack food, greater sweetened beverage intake, fewer fruit-and-vegetable classroom breaks, and less encouragement for healthy eating compared with students who remained in the same school. School staff surveys showed that more primary than secondary schools had written healthy canteen policies and fewer days of canteen or food services operation. CONCLUSION: A change of school environment has negative effects on children's obesity-related dietary behavior. Consistent policy is needed across school types to support healthy eating in school environments.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Increasingly high rates of obesity have heightened interest among researchers and practitioners in identifying evidence-based interventions to increase access to healthful foods and beverages. Because most food purchasing decisions are made in food stores, such settings are optimal for interventions aimed at influencing these decisions. The objective of this review was to synthesize the evidence on supermarket and grocery store interventions to promote healthful food choices. METHODS: We searched PubMed through July 2012 to identify original research articles evaluating supermarket and grocery store interventions that promoted healthful food choices. We categorized each intervention by type of intervention strategy and extracted and summarized data on each intervention. We developed a scoring system for evaluating each intervention and assigned points for study design, effectiveness, reach, and availability of evidence. We averaged points for each intervention category and compared the strength of the evidence for each category. RESULTS: We identified 58 articles and characterized 33 interventions. We found 7 strategies used alone or in combination. The most frequently used strategy was the combination of point-of-purchase and promotion and advertising (15 interventions); evidence for this category was scored as sufficient. On average, of 3 points possible, the intervention categories scored 2.6 for study design, 1.1 for effectiveness, 0.3 for reach, and 2 for availability of evidence. Three categories showed sufficient evidence; 4 showed insufficient evidence; none showed strong evidence. CONCLUSION: More rigorous testing of interventions aimed at improving food and beverage choices in food stores, including their effect on diet and health outcomes, is needed.},

  abstract = {Abstract Typically, shoppers' paths only cover less than half of the areas in a grocery store. Given that shoppers often use physical products in the store as external memory cues, encouraging shoppers to travel more of the store may increase unplanned spending. Estimating the direct effect of in-store travel distance on unplanned spending, however, is complicated by the difficulty of collecting in-store path data and the endogeneity of in-store travel distance. To address both issues, the authors collect a novel data set using in-store radio frequency identification tracking and develop an instrumental variable approach to account for endogeneity. Their analysis reveals that the elasticity of unplanned spending on travel distance is 57\% higher than the uncorrected ordinary least squares estimate. Simulations based on the authors' estimates suggest that strategically promoting three product categories through mobile promotion could increase unplanned spending by 16.1\%, compared with the estimated effect of a benchmark strategy based on relocating three destination categories (7.2\%). Furthermore, the authors conduct a field experiment to assess the effectiveness of mobile promotions and find that a coupon that required shoppers to travel farther from their planned path resulted in a substantial increase in unplanned spending (\$21.29) over a coupon for an unplanned category near their planned path (\$13.83). The results suggest that targeted mobile promotions aimed at increasing in-store path length can increase unplanned spending.},

In all cases, agriculture is the most energy and exergy intensive process and emits most of the carbon dioxide, and diesel is the dominant energy and exergy source. The cumulative degree of perfection (CDP) for soybean and olive oil is 0.92 and 0.98, respectively, whereas the CDP for the sunflower oil is 2.36. Decreasing diesel consumption with good agricultural practices and substituting with biodiesel from renewable resources would decrease the cumulative exergy consumption, as a result, CDP of olive and soybean oil rises to 1.6 and sunflower oil to 2.9. Major contribution to the carbon dioxide emission is due to the excessive use of fertilizers. The most energy intensive process is olive oil production. However, since the fertilizer consumption here is limited, total carbon dioxide emission is less than those of the other two processes are. On the other hand, excessive fertilizer consumption during the soybean agriculture results in a rather large CO2 emission.},

To do so, the present research examines the intersection of ideal weight goal progress and regulatory orientation on consumer health-related decisions. Across two experimental studies, findings suggest that those far away from their ideal weight goals are more inclined to participate in adaptive health behaviors. The first study shows that individuals are calibrated in terms of their health goals. Specifically, when they are far away from their ideal weight, they want to eat healthier and exercise. However, their health goals are not calibrated appropriately in the presence of regulatory incongruence of individual regulatory orientation and promotion type. Specifically, prevention-oriented individuals do not report the appropriate outcome expectation of the goal pursuit; instead, the present study finds that they do not want to increase exercise even when they are far from their health goal.

In this research, we identify the home as just such an environment and argue that the dietary gatekeeper within the home has a significant influence on what a family eats and subsequently the health status of family members. We propose a model that relates dietary gatekeeper cognitions and food-related capabilities to food acquisition and transformation practices and subsequent diet outcomes. An online survey was completed by 326 US and 323 Australian dietary gatekeepers to test the relationships in the model. Our results suggest improving dietary gatekeepers' capabilities, including their cooking confidence and nutritional confidence, and their food acquisition and food transformation practices can have positive health benefits for gatekeepers and their families. Implications for health policymakers and food marketers are presented.},

The objective of the present cross-sectional study was to evaluate the associations among fruit and vegetable consumption, intake of foods high in saturated fat, and executive functions using the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning\textendash{}Adult Version. A total of 240 university students completed the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning\textendash{}Adult Version, the 26-Item Eating Attitudes Test, and the Diet subscale of the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities Questionnaire. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted with two separate models in which fruit and vegetable consumption and saturated fat intake were the outcomes. Demographic variables, body mass index, and eating styles were controlled for in the analysis. Better initiation skills were associated with greater intake of fruits and vegetables in the last 7 days (standardized beta = -0.17; p $<$ 0.05). Stronger inhibitory control was associated with less consumption of high fat foods in the last 7 days (standardized beta = 0.20; p $<$ 0.05) in the multiple linear regression analysis. Executive functions that predict fruit and vegetable consumption are distinct from those that predict avoidance of foods high in saturated fat. Future research should investigate whether continued skill enhancement in initiation and inhibition following standard behavioral interventions improves long-term maintenance of weight loss.},

  shorttitle = {Nudging towards Nutrition?},
  abstract = {Obesity is one of the most contentious issues facing the United States today. Some researchers warn of an obesity "epidemic" that poses a grave threat to our nation's health, while others attack these claims as alarmist and misguided. This divide reinforces the political schism between advocates of government intervention and anti-regulatory groups. As a result, obesity science finds itself entangled in partisan battles that leave little room for compromise. This paper explores the potential for the political philosophy of soft paternalism to provide a regulatory framework that may appeal to both sides of the obesity reform debate. Soft paternalism draws upon social science research in order to develop policies that encourage better decision-making, while preserving individual choice. Applying this framework to the issue of obesity, I look at two areas of potential reform: 1) information-based policies such as nutritional label design, and 2) policies that affect default choices, such as portion size norms. I find that while soft paternalism is an appealing framework that offers many promising reforms, it is not a panacea. Instead, I argue that these proposals should be considered on their own merit, not as a complete solution precluding other measures. In addition, in light of potential criticism concerning the stigmatizing effect of some obesity-related measures, I suggest that reforms based on soft paternalism can and should be tailored to promote more mindful eating habits. With these concerns in mind, I conclude that soft paternalism is a promising approach that warrants serious consideration by policymakers.},

Models of behavior, such as the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) allow program designers to identify antecedents of dietary patterns and design effective interventions. The primary aim of this study was to examine the association between TPB variables and dietary patterns. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to calculate average correlations. Meta-regression was used to test the impact of moderator variables. In total, 22 reports met the inclusion criteria. Attitudes had the strongest association with intention (r+ = 0.61) followed by perceived behavioral control (PBC, r+ = 0.46) and subjective norm (r+ = 0.35). The association between intention and behavior was r+ = 0.47, and between PBC and behavior r+ = 0.32. These associations were robust to the influence of key moderators. However, analyses revealed that younger participants had stronger PBC-behavior associations than older participants, and studies recording participants' perceptions of behavior reported significantly higher intention-behavior associations than those using less subjective measures. Recommendations for future research include further examination of the moderation of TPB variables by age and gender and the use of more valid measures of eating behavior.},

These insights fall into the following categories: the influence of starting points (status quo bias and anchoring effects); communicating health information (simplicity and framing); and unintended consequences of policy interventions (compensation, substitution, and the peanuts effect). The paper discusses opportunities for improving the design of food policies and interventions by altering default options, providing the public with simple and meaningful nutrition information, carefully constructing the framing of public health messages, and designing food policies to minimize unintended consequences, such as compensation and substitution.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The present study constructed a short form of the Healthy Eating Behavior Inventory suitable for use in the Japanese culture (HEBI-J) and confirmed the scale's preliminary reliability and validity. METHODS: In Study 1, Japanese adults (N=75) completed a free-response questionnaire about healthy eating behaviours. Thematic analysis was used to identify three factors-balance, pattern, and restriction-associated with healthy eating behaviours and 12 items related to these healthy eating behaviours. In Study 2, Japanese office workers (N=784) completed two questionnaires regarding 12 items of healthy eating behaviours and the dietary stages of change. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that the three-factor model was appropriate (GFI=.94, AGFI=.90, CFI=.90, RMSEA=.08, SRMR=.53). Reliability was confirmed by alpha coefficients and the Spearman-Brown formula. Concurrent validity was confirmed by the relationship between the healthy eating stages. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the preliminary reliability and validity of the HEBI-J.},

It is functional and utilitarian, yet also hedonistic. Food consumption is also often a social act and our environment strongly influences what we consume. Yet, despite its obvious importance to us and our well-being, it appears that as a society the consumption of food has led to a variety of difficult challenges that require some level of behavior change by consumers. Though several decades of research have sought to find answers to the many food consumption challenges that exist, it appears that excessive consumption of the ``wrong'' foods and its consequences (e.g., obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, etc.) have begun to override prior concerns about food consumption deficit. Levels of obesity seem to be rising globally and apparently ``no national success stories have been reported in the past 33 years'' (Ng et~al., 2014, p. 766).},

Method A school-based, cross-sectional study using a quantitative design was carried out during October 2014. The participants were secondary schoolchildren in grades 11 and 12. Data were analysed using SPSS program version 17. Percentages, standard deviations and means were computed. Findings The main suggestions were for programmes at school, during school hours (n=962, 85.4\%), followed by one that involved family and friends (n=951, 84.5\%), and a programme at a convenient time free of charge (n=919, 81.6\%). The students also suggested many strategies to tackle overweight and obesity, such as: taking more physical exercise (n=925, 82.1\%), increasing consumption of more fruit and vegetables (n=712, 63.2\%) eating less fast food (n=689, 61.2\%). Conclusion Schools, families, health providers and community organisations should encourage students to adopt healthy lifestyles, and facilitate their selection and participation in health programmes.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the impact of consumer confusion on nutrition knowledge, literacy, and dietary behavior. While previous research largely focuses on understanding why consumers might not respond to healthy eating communications, this paper seeks to uncover the various behavioral responses to such campaigns, particularly those that contravene health communication objectives. Using an interpretive methodology, findings suggest that most participants do respond to health communications by striving to eat healthily, but inadequate nutrition information derived from unreliable sources, flawed baseline nutrition knowledge, and poor nutrition literacy hinder participants' efforts. Inconsistent, incomplete, and contradictory information leaves many participants feeling confused about how to implement healthy eating habits. Further, a lack of ability to differentiate between credible and unreliable sources of nutrition information means that many participants blame their confusion on policymakers, and express frustration and cynicism toward vague and often contradictory communications. This, in turn, increases participants' reliance on food adverts, product labels, and other commercial sources of ambiguous yet appealing information. The paper's theoretical contribution includes a consumer confusion framework for healthy eating, and policy implications highlight that health campaigns seeking to increase consumer awareness of healthy eating are not enough. Policymakers must become the most credible sources of information about healthy eating, and distinguish themselves from competing and unreliable sources of nutrition information.},

However, there has been a lack of systematic reviews focusing on how the consumer food environment is associated with the following: (1) neighborhood characteristics; (2) food prices; (3) dietary patterns; and (4) weight status. We conducted a systematic review of primary, quantitative, observational studies, published in English that conducted an audit of the consumer food environment. The literature search included electronic, hand searches, and peer-reviewed from 2000 to 2011. Fifty six papers met the inclusion criteria. Six studies reported stores in low income neighborhoods or high minority neighborhoods had less availability of healthy food. While, four studies found there was no difference in availability between neighborhoods. The results were also inconsistent for differences in food prices, dietary patterns, and weight status. This systematic review uncovered several key findings. (1) Systematic measurement of determining availability of food within stores and store types is needed; (2) Context is relevant for understanding the complexities of the consumer food environment; (3) Interventions and longitudinal studies addressing purchasing habits, diet, and obesity outcomes are needed; and (4) Influences of price and marketing that may be linked with why people purchase certain items.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of food production processes on the environment in terms of energy and exergy utilization and carbon dioxide emission. There are three different energy utilization mechanisms in food production: Utilization of solar energy by plants to produce agricultural goods; feed consumption by herbivores to produce meat and milk; fossil fuel consumption by industrial processes to perform mixing, cooling, heating, etc. Production of strawberry-flavored yogurt, which involves these three mechanisms, is investigated here thermodynamically. Analysis starts with the cultivation of the ingredients and ends with the transfer of the final product to the market. The results show that 53\% of the total exergy loss occurs during the milk production and 80\% of the total work input is consumed during the plain yogurt making. The cumulative degree of perfection is 3.6\% for the strawberry-flavored yogurt. This value can rise up to 4.6\%, if renewable energy resources like hydropower and algal biodiesel are employed instead of fossil fuels. This paper points the direction for the development of new technology in food processing to decrease waste of energy and carbon dioxide accumulation in the atmosphere.},

In study 1, the shelf placement and eye positioning of 86 cereal spokes-characters were evaluated in 10 grocery stores in the Eastern United States. We calculated the average height of cereal boxes on the shelf for adult- versus children-oriented cereals (48 in. vs. 23 in.) and the inflection angle of spokes-characters' gaze (0.4$^\circ$ vs. -9.6$^\circ$). We found that cereal characters on child- (adult-) oriented cereals make incidental eye contact at children's (adults') eye level. In Study 2, we showed that eye contact with cereal spokes-characters increased feelings of trust and connection to the brand, as well as choice of the brand over competitors. Currently, many of the cereals targeted toward children are of the heavily sugared, less healthy variety. One potential application of this finding would be to use eye contact with spokes-characters to promote healthy choices and healthier food consumption.},

  abstract = {Research on overeating and self-regulation has associated eating pleasure with short-term visceral impulses triggered by hunger, external cues, or internal emotional urges. Drawing on research on the social and cultural dimensions of eating, we contrast this approach with what we call "Epicurean" eating pleasures, which are the enduring pleasures derived from the aesthetic appreciation of the sensory and symbolic value of the food. To contrast both approaches, we develop and test a scale measuring Epicurean eating pleasure tendencies and show that they are distinct from the tendency to experience visceral pleasure (measured using the external eating and emotional eating scales). We find that Epicurean eating pleasure is more prevalent among women than men but is independent of age, income and education. Unlike visceral eating pleasure tendencies, Epicurean eating tendencies are associated with a preference for smaller food portions and with higher well-being, and are not associated with higher BMI. Overall, we argue that the moralizing approach equating the pleasure of eating with 'low-level' visceral urges should give way to a more holistic approach which recognizes the positive role that "Epicurean" eating pleasure can play for healthy eating and food well-being.},

Various determinants of healthy eating \textendash{} such as Weight Concern, Nutrition Knowledge, Concern for Disease, Social Influence, and Food Choice Motive \textendash{} have been manipulated by persuasive technologies to motivate healthy eating behavior. However, the relative importance and the dynamic of interaction between the determinants of healthy behavior for males and females are still unknown. Understanding how the determinants vary across user groups is important, as it will help persuasive technology designers personalize their interventions to the target demographics, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the intervention. To investigate for possible variations in healthy eating determinants, we developed separate models of healthy eating determinants for males and females. The models, which are based on a quantitative study of 228 (124 males and 104 females) participants, reveal some similarities and differences in the interactions between the determinants of healthy eating behavior. Based on the result from our models, we highlight some gender-inclusive and gender-specific approaches to persuasive intervention design.},

After a 5- to 7-week baseline phase, participants were randomly assigned to an experimental or control condition for the 7- to 8-week intervention phase. A follow-up phase began 5 to 8 weeks after participants completed the intervention and discontinued use of the system. The results indicated that experimental participants, when compared to control participants, decreased high fat purchases and increased high fiber purchases during intervention, with evidence for some maintenance of effect in follow-up. Plans for increasing the use and impact of the system are discussed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Grocery stores and community settings are important and promising venues for environmental, policy, and pricing initiatives to increase fruit and vegetable intake. This article examines supermarket-based and community environmental, policy, and pricing strategies for increasing intake of fruits and vegetables and identifies promising strategies, research needs, and innovative opportunities for the future. METHODS: The strategies, examples, and research reported here were identified through an extensive search of published journal articles, reports, and inquiries to leaders in the field. Recommendations were expanded with input from participants in the CDC/ACS-sponsored Fruit and Vegetable, Environment Policy and Pricing Workshop held in September of 2002. RESULTS: Four key types of grocery-store-based interventions include point-of-purchase (POP) information; reduced prices and coupons; increased availability, variety, and convenience; and promotion and advertising. There is strong support for the feasibility of these approaches and modest evidence of their efficacy in influencing eating behavior. Church-based programs, child care center policies, and multisectoral community approaches show promise. CONCLUSIONS: Both descriptive and intervention research are needed to develop and evaluate more effective environmental strategies to increase F\&V intake in grocery stores and communities. Innovative strategies, partnerships, grass roots action involving economic development for low-income communities, and sustainability are important considerations.},

Economic interventions like taxes can shift the relative prices of unhealthy foods to nudge consumers towards healthier options. Beverages with added sugar are a good starting point for food taxation; they constitute over 10 percent of caloric intake nationwide and provide little or no nutritional value. Current levels of taxation on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are too low to affect consumer behavior, but the implementation of a penny-per-ounce excise tax could lead to substantial public health benefits. Current estimates predict that a tax that raised the cost of SSBs by 20 percent could lead to an average reduction of 3.8 pounds per year for adults, causing the prevalence of obesity to decline from 33 to 30 percent. SSB taxes would also generate considerable revenue for public health and obesity prevention programs. Although the beverage industry is fighting such taxes with massive lobbying and public relations campaigns, support for the policies is increasing, especially when revenue is earmarked for obesity prevention.},

  abstract = {Dietary behavior and attitude play major roles in the worldwide prevalence of obesity, as weight is gained when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure. Although research has focused on designing technological interventions for healthy eating behavior, recent reviews have identified a gap in the knowledge base regarding the variables/determinants of healthy eating and the interactions between them. We developed a model of some determinants and their impact on healthy eating as a basis for designing technological interventions to promote healthy eating behavior within a target community. The main goal of this work is to understand how people adopt a healthy eating attitude, the variables influencing such attitudes, the interactions between these variables, and the degree of influence each variable exerts on healthy eating attitudes. We use fast food-related eating behavior as our case study. Our model shows that weight concern, nutrition knowledge, concern for diseases, social influence, and food choice motives predicts 65\% of the variance in healthy eating attitudes, showing the suitability of the model for use in predicting healthy eating attitude. This result will inform decisions on the most effective persuasive strategy for designing interventions to promote healthy eating behavior.},

Most arguments in describing the ramifications of a tax fail to consider demand interrelationships among various beverages. To circumvent this shortcoming we employ a variation of Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS) model. The consumption of isotonics, regular soft drinks and fruit drinks, the set of SSBs, is negatively impacted by the proposed tax, while the consumption of fruit juices, low-fat milk, coffee, and tea is positively affected. Diversion ratios are provided identifying where the volumes of the SSBs are directed as a result of the tax policy. The reduction in the body weight as a result of a 20\% tax on SSBs is estimated to be between 1.54 and 2.55 lb per year. However, not considering demand interrelationships would result in higher weight loss. Unequivocally, it is necessary to consider interrelationships among non-alcoholic beverages in assessing the effect of the tax.},

One alternative that has been widely proposed is an excise or sales tax on sugar-sweetened non-alcoholic beverages. This literature started out within a very simple partial equilibrium framework. Not considering the feedback effects (or general equilibrium effects) across interrelated market is a shortcoming of these partial equilibrium analyses. Our study is carried out to ascertain stochastic partial and general equilibrium calorie, body weight and revenue effects of a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages as well as incidence of such tax. We used Nielsen Homescan data on prices and quantities of selected non-alcoholic beverages purchased over the period January 1998 through December 2008. Probability density functions (pdfs) generated using simulations of calorie outcomes reveal that the calorie reduction due to tax on sugar-sweetened beverages is between 465 and 716 calories per person per month. However, consideration of both direct and indirect effects in generating the effect of the tax on sugar-sweetened beverages reveal reduction as low as 199 calories per person per month and as high as707 calories per person per month.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new method of assessing the relationship between features of the built environment and obesity, particularly in urban areas. Our empirical application combines georeferenced data on the location of fast-food restaurants with data about personal health, behavioral, and neighborhood characteristics. We define a 'local food environment' for every individual utilizing buffers around a person's home address. Individual food landscapes are potentially endogenous because of spatial sorting of the population and food outlets, and the body mass index (BMI) values for individuals living close to each other are likely to be spatially correlated because of observed and unobserved individual and neighborhood effects. The potential biases associated with endogeneity and spatial correlation are handled using spatial econometric estimation techniques. Our application provides quantitative estimates of the effect of proximity to fast-food restaurants on obesity in an urban food market. We also present estimates of a policy simulation that focuses on reducing the density of fast-food restaurants in urban areas. In the simulations, we account for spatial heterogeneity in both the policy instruments and individual neighborhoods and find a small effect for the hypothesized relationships between individual BMI values and the density of fast-food restaurants.},

  abstract = {Individuals with obesity often appear reluctant to undertake dietary changes. Evaluating the reasons for this reluctance, as well as appropriate policy responses, is hampered by a lack of data on behavioral response to dietary advice. I use household scanner data to estimate food purchase response to a diagnosis of diabetes, a common complication of obesity. I infer diabetes diagnosis within the scanner data from purchases of glucose testing products. Households engage in statistically significant but small calorie reductions following diagnosis. The changes are sufficient to lose 4 to 8 pounds in the first year, but are only about 10\% of what would be suggested by a doctor. The scanner data allows detailed analysis of changes by food type. In the first month after diagnosis, healthy foods increase and unhealthy foods decrease. However, only the decreases in unhealthy food persist. Changes are most pronounced on large, unhealthy, food categories. Those individuals whose pre-diagnosis diet is concentrated in one or a few foods groups show bigger subsequent calorie reductions, with these reductions occurring primarily occurring in these largest food groups. I suggest the facts may be consistent with a psychological framework in which rule-based behavior change is more successful. I compare the results to a policy of taxes or subsidies.},

  abstract = {Objectives We assessed the efficacy of an easy-to-implement shopper marketing nutrition intervention in a pilot and two additional studies to increase produce demand without decreasing store profitability or increasing shopper budgets. Methods We created grocery cart placards that detailed the number of produce items purchased (i.e., descriptive norm) at particular stores (i.e., provincial norm). The effect of these placards on produce spending was assessed across 971,706 individual person grocery store transactions aggregated by day. The pilot study designated a baseline period (in both control and intervention store) followed by installation of grocery cart placards (in the intervention store) for two weeks. The pilot study was conducted in Texas in 2012. In two additional stores, we designated baseline periods followed by 28 days of the same grocery cart placard intervention as in the pilot. Additional interventions were conducted in New Mexico in 2013. Results The pilot study resulted in a significant difference between average produce spending per day per person across treatment periods (i.e., intervention versus same time period in control) (16\%) and the difference between average produce spending per day per person across stores in the control periods (4\%); Furthermore, the same intervention in two additional stores resulted in significant produce spending increases of 12.4\% and 7.5\% per day per person respectively. In all stores, total spending did not change. Conclusions Descriptive and provincial social norm messages (i.e., on grocery cart placards) may be an overlooked tool to increase produce demand without decreasing store profitability and increasing shopper budgets.},

In many applications the treatment-determining covariate is discrete. This makes it impossible to compare outcomes for observations ``just above'' and ``just below'' the treatment threshold, and requires the researcher to choose a functional form for the relationship between the treatment variable and the outcomes of interest. We propose a simple econometric procedure to account for uncertainty in the choice of functional form for RD designs with discrete support. In particular, we model deviations of the true regression function from a given approximating function\textemdash{}the specification errors\textemdash{}as random. Conventional standard errors ignore the group structure induced by specification errors and tend to overstate the precision of the estimated program impacts. The proposed inference procedure that allows for specification error also has a natural interpretation within a Bayesian framework.},

We focus on estimation by local linear regression, which was shown to have attractive properties (Porter, J. 2003, ``Estimation in the Regression Discontinuity Model'' (unpublished, Department of Economics, University of Wisconsin, Madison)). We derive the asymptotically optimal bandwidth under squared error loss. This optimal bandwidth depends on unknown functionals of the distribution of the data and we propose simple and consistent estimators for these functionals to obtain a fully data-driven bandwidth algorithm. We show that this bandwidth estimator is optimal according to the criterion of Li (1987, ``Asymptotic Optimality for Cp, CL, Cross-validation and Generalized Cross-validation: Discrete Index Set'', Annals of Statistics, 15, 958\textendash{}975), although it is not unique in the sense that alternative consistent estimators for the unknown functionals would lead to bandwidth estimators with the same optimality properties. We illustrate the proposed bandwidth, and the sensitivity to the choices made in our algorithm, by applying the methods to a data set previously analysed by Lee (2008, ``Randomized Experiments from Non-random Selection in U.S. House Elections'', Journal of Econometrics, 142, 675\textendash{}697) as well as by conducting a small simulation study.},

Both incentive arms used deposit contracts (DC) in which participants put their own money at risk (matched 1:1), which they lost if they failed to lose weight. In one incentive arm participants were told that the period after 24 weeks was for weight-loss maintenance; in the other, no such distinction was made.MAIN MEASUREWeight loss after 32 weeks.KEY RESULTSResults were analyzed using intention-to-treat. There was no difference in weight loss between the incentive arms (P = 0.80). Incentive participants lost more weight than control participants [mean DC = 8.70 pounds, mean control = 1.17, P = 0.04, 95\% CI of the difference in means (0.56, 14.50)]. Follow-up data 36 weeks after the 32-week intervention had ended indicated weight regain; the net weight loss between the incentive and control groups was no longer significant (mean DC = 1.2 pounds, 95\% CI, -2.58\textendash{}5.00; mean control = 0.27, 95\% CI, -3.77\textendash{}4.30, P = 0.76).CONCLUSIONSFinancial incentives produced significant weight loss over an 8-month intervention; however, participants regained weight post-intervention.},

  abstract = {Objective
Population-level strategies to improve healthy food choices are needed for obesity prevention. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of 2672 employees at the Massachusetts General Hospital who were regular customers of the hospital cafeteria with all items labeled green (healthy), yellow (less healthy), or red (unhealthy) to determine if social norm (peer-comparison) feedback with or without financial incentives increased employees' healthy food choices.
Methods
Participants were randomized in 2012 to three arms: 1) monthly letter with social norm feedback about healthy food purchases, comparing employee to ``all'' and to ``healthiest'' customers (feedback-only); 2) monthly letter with social norm feedback plus small financial incentive for increasing green purchases (feedback-incentive); or 3) no contact (control). The main outcome was change in proportion of green-labeled purchases at the end of 3-month intervention. Post-hoc analyses examined linear trends.
Results
At baseline, the proportion of green-labeled purchases (50\%) did not differ between arms. At the end of the 3-month intervention, the percentage increase in green-labeled purchases was larger in the feedback-incentive arm compared to control (2.2\% vs. 0.1\%, P = 0.03), but the two intervention arms were not different. The rate of increase in green-labeled purchases was higher in both feedback-only (P = 0.04) and feedback-incentive arms (P = 0.004) compared to control. At the end of a 3-month wash-out, there were no differences between control and intervention arms.
Conclusions
Social norms plus small financial incentives increased employees' healthy food choices over the short-term. Future research will be needed to assess the impact of this relatively low-cost intervention on employees' food choices and weight over the long-term.

  abstract = {Background
An activity tracker combined with a smartphone application (smartcare) may help people track and receive feedback on their own activities. However, activity trackers themselves generally fail to drive long-term sustained engagement for a majority of users. One potential strategy for increasing the effectiveness of smartcare is through the use of incentives. The purpose of this pilot randomized trial is to test the feasibility of our intervention and to assess the extent to which smartcare with or without financial incentives can increase physical activity levels and reduce weight over a 12-week period.
Methods/design
This study employs a three-arm, open-label randomized controlled trial design: control (standard basic education), smartcare, and smartcare plus financial incentives. Male university students with body mass index $\geq$ 27 are enrolled. Our primary and secondary endpoints are the amount of weight loss and the level of physical activity respectively. The weight loss goal is 3\% of baseline at week 4, 5\% at week 8, and 7\% at week 12. The daily physical activity goal was individualized according to the participants' weight. Process incentives are accumulated when participants met daily physical activity goals, and outcome incentives are provided when they met weight reduction goals.
Discussion
Given the global increase in physical inactivity and obesity, there is a growing need for effective, scalable, and affordable health promotion strategies. Our proof-of-concept study will provide the evidence for the combination of rising health promotion technology of activity trackers and smartphone applications with the modern concept of behavioral economics using financial incentives.},

This study investigates whether the response of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants to a 30\% incentive on fruit and vegetable spending varies with their access to food retailers.

The analysis exploits the random assignment of SNAP households in Hampden County, MA, to an intervention group that earned the incentive. Regression models for the impact of the incentive are augmented with measures of food retail access and interactions of random assignment status with food retail access. The main outcome\textemdash{}use of the SNAP benefit\textemdash{}is based on Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card transaction records.
Results
Although households that lived within a mile of a participating supermarket spent approximately \$2.13 or 19\% more per month on targeted fruits and vegetables at participating supermarkets than households that did not live within a mile of a participating supermarket, we found no evidence that the impact of the incentive on SNAP fruit and vegetable spending varies with distance to retailers.
Conclusions
These findings imply that incentives to purchase fruits and vegetables were equally efficacious for SNAP households with high and low access to food retailers.},

  abstract = {High prices remain a formidable barrier for many people, especially those of low socioeconomic status, to adopt a healthier diet. The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 mandated the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to conduct a pilot study to assess the impact of making fruits and vegetables more affordable for households in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Based on the USDA final report of the Healthy Incentives Pilot (HIP), a large-scale randomized trial in 2011\textendash{}2012 that provided 30\% rebate on targeted fruits and vegetables to 7500 study participants enrolled in the SNAP, we constructed a decision model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an expansion of the HIP to all SNAP households nationwide. The estimated life-time per capita costs of the HIP to the Federal government is \$1323 in 2012 U.S. dollars, and the average gains in quality-adjusted life expectancy to a SNAP participant is 0.082 quality-adjusted life year (QALY), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of \$16,172 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulations indicates a 94.4\% and 99.6\% probability that the estimated ICER would be lower than the cost-effective threshold of \$50,000 and \$100,000 per QALY gained, respectively. Moreover, the estimated ICER of the HIP expansion tends to be competitive in comparison to other interventions that aimed at promoting fruit/vegetable intake among adult population. Findings from this study suggest that a nationwide expansion of the HIP is likely to nudge SNAP households towards purchasing and consuming more targeted fruits and vegetables. However, diet behavior modification is proportional to price change. When people's actual eating behaviors and what dietary guidelines recommend differ by several folds, even a 30\% rebate closes just a small fraction of that gap and has limited beneficial impact on participants' weight management, disease prevention, and health-related quality of life.},

  abstract = {Objective
To examine the association of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and diet quality among low-income adults.
Patients and Methods
We examined US nationally representative data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2003-2004, 2005-2006, 2007-2008, and 2009-2010. The data were analyzed from October 7, 2013, to March 1, 2014. The analytic sample consisted of 4211 low-income adults aged 20 to 64 years, of whom 1830 participate in SNAP. We adhered to the National Cancer Institute method in calculating the Healthy Eating Index 2010 and other dietary indicators, such as empty calorie intake. Bivariate and multivariable regression was used to compare SNAP participants and income-eligible nonparticipants among the full sample and subsamples of age, sex, race/ethnicity, and food insecurity.
Results
Compared with low-income nonparticipants, adjusted analyses reveal that SNAP participants had lower dietary quality scores overall (42.58 vs 44.36, P$\leq$.0001) and lower scores for fruits and vegetables, seafood and plant proteins (1.55 vs 1.77, P$\leq$.0022), and empty calories (9.03 vs 9.90, P$\leq$.0001), but they exhibited comparable scores on whole grain, refined grain, total dairy, total protein, fatty acid, and sodium intakes. The association between SNAP participation and lower dietary quality was statistically significant among women, Hispanics, young adults, and individuals who were food secure.
Conclusion
Our analyses suggest that SNAP participants have lower dietary quality than their income-eligible nonparticipant counterparts. Although SNAP has an important role in providing nutrition assistance to eligible low-income individuals, interventions are warranted to improve the dietary quality of participants.},

For example, monetary incentives from principals may change how tasks are perceived by agents, with negative effects on behavior. In other cases, incentives might have the desired effects in the short term, but they still weaken intrinsic motivations. To put it in concrete terms, an incentive for a child to learn to read might achieve that goal in the short term, but then be counterproductive as an incentive for students to enjoy reading and seek it out over their lifetimes. Next we examine the research literature on three important examples in which monetary incentives have been used in a nonemployment context to foster the desired behavior: education; increasing contributions to public goods; and helping people change their lifestyles, particularly with regard to smoking and exercise. The conclusion sums up some lessons on when extrinsic incentives are more or less likely to alter such behaviors in the desired directions.},

  abstract = {The poor diets of many consumers are often attributed to limited access to healthy foods. In this paper, we use detailed data describing both the healthfulness of household food purchases and the retail landscapes facing consumers to measure the role that access plays in explaining why some people in the United States eat more nutritious foods than others. We first confirm that households with lower income and education purchase less healthful foods. We then measure the spatial variation in the average nutritional quality of available food products across local markets, revealing that healthy foods are less likely to be available in low-income neighborhoods. Though significant, spatial differences in access are small and explain only a fraction of the variation that we observe in the nutritional content of household purchases. Systematic socioeconomic disparities in household purchases persist after controlling for access: even in the same store, more educated households purchase more healthful foods. Consistent with this result, we further find that the nutritional quality of household purchases responds very little to changes in the retail environment, especially among households with low levels of income and education. Together, our results indicate that policies aimed at improving access to healthy foods in underserved areas will leave most of the socioeconomic disparities in nutritional consumption intact.},

  abstract = {Objective This study examined the accuracy of a multiplepass, 24 hour dietary recall method for estimating energy intakes of men and women by comparing it with energy intake required for weight maintenance.

Design Threeday, multiplepass, 24-hour recalls were obtained on randomly selected days during a selfselected diet period when subjects were preparing their own meals and during a controlled diet period when all meals were provided by the study. During the dietary intervention, weight was maintained; body weight and dietary intake were monitored closely, thereby allowing estimation of the energy intake required for weight maintenance.

Subjects/setting Seventyeight men and women (22 to 67 years old) from the Dietary Effects on Lipoprotein and Thrombogenic Activity (DELTA) study participated in this study. All 24-hour recalls were collected using a computerassisted, interactive, multiplepass telephone interview technique. Energy requirements for each individual were determined by the energy content of the DELTA study foods provided to maintain weight.

Statistical analysis Paired and independent t tests were conducted to examine differences among study variables. Agreement between recalled energy intake and weight maintenance energy intake was analyzed using the BlandAltman technique.

Results Compared with weight maintenance energy intake, during the selfselected diet period men and women underestimated energy intake by 11\% and 13\%, respectively. During the controlled diet period, men underestimated energy intake by 13\%, whereas women overestimated energy by 1.3\%.

Applications/conclusions Men had a tendency to underestimate energy intake irrespective of the recording period. The accuracy of the recalled energy intake of women may be influenced by recording circumstances. Researchers should examine the factors influencing underreporting and overreporting by individuals and their impact on macronutrient and micronutrient intakes. Also, strategies need to be developed to minimize underreporting and overreporting. J Am Diet Assoc. 2000; 100:303-308,311.},

  abstract = {Objective
To identify characteristics associated with misreporting of energy intake during 24-hour dietary recalls (24HR).
Design
Ninety-eight subjects were administered two 24HRs. Energy expenditure was determined by doubly labeled water (44 subjects) or intake balance (54 subjects). Data on subjects' physical, lifestyle, and psychosocial characteristics were also collected.
Subjects/setting
At the Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center 52 women and 46 men were administered 24HR and completed lifestyle and personality questionnaires and a memory test. Physical characteristics such as weight, percent body fat, and total energy expenditure were measured.
Statistical analysis
The influences of subject parameters on energy misreporting were assessed by linear regression and Pearson product-moment correlation analysis for continuous variables and by ANOVA for discrete variables. Stepwise regression was used to identify key factors in underreporting.
Results
Factors particularly important in predicting underreporting of energy intake include factors indicating dissatisfaction with body image; for example, a 398 kcal/day underreport in subjects attempting weight loss during the past year with a nearly 500 kcal/day underreport in women. Overall, women underreported by 393 kcal/day relative to men and women evinced a social desirability bias amounting to a 26 kcal underreport for each point on the social desirability scale. Gender differences also were evident in the effect of percent body fat (with men underreporting about 16 kcal/day/percent body fat) and in departure from self-reported ideal body weight (with women underreporting about 21 kcal/day/kg).
Applications/conclusions
Body image and fatness are key factors on which health professionals should focus when seeking predictors of underreporting of dietary intake. Dietary interviews must be conducted to minimize bias related to subjects' tendencies to win approval and avoid censure by the interviewer. In addition, dissatisfaction with body image may lead to underestimation of food intake, therefore reducing likelihood of success in weight loss. Thus, health care professionals involved in weight loss counseling may achieve better success if treatment includes generating a more positive body image.},

  abstract = {Study question What has been the effect on purchases of beverages from stores in Mexico one year after implementation of the excise tax on sugar sweetened beverages?
Methods In this observational study the authors used data on the purchase of beverages in Mexico from January 2012 to December 2014 from an unbalanced panel of 6253 households providing 205 112 observations in 53 cities with more than 50 000 inhabitants. To test whether the post-tax trend in purchases was significantly different from the pretax trend, the authors used a difference in difference fixed effects model, which adjusts for both macroeconomic variables that can affect the purchase of beverages over time, and pre-existing trends. The variables used in the analysis included demographic information on household composition (age and sex of household members) and socioeconomic status (low, middle, and high). The authors compared the predicted volumes (mL/capita/day) of taxed and untaxed beverages purchased in 2014\textemdash{}the observed post-tax period\textemdash{}with the estimated volumes that would have been purchased if the tax had not been implemented (counterfactual) based on pretax trends.
Study answer and limitations Relative to the counterfactual in 2014, purchases of taxed beverages decreased by an average of 6\% (-12 mL/capita/day), and decreased at an increasing rate up to a 12\% decline by December 2014. All three socioeconomic groups reduced purchases of taxed beverages, but reductions were higher among the households of low socioeconomic status, averaging a 9\% decline during 2014, and up to a 17\% decrease by December 2014 compared with pretax trends. Purchases of untaxed beverages were 4\% (36 mL/capita/day) higher than the counterfactual, mainly driven by an increase in purchases of bottled plain water.
What this study adds The tax on sugar sweetened beverages was associated with reductions in purchases of taxed beverages and increases in purchases of untaxed beverages. Continued monitoring is needed to understand purchases longer term, potential substitutions, and health implications.

  abstract = {A method and system for gathering and analyzing customer and purchasing information permits a retailer or retail chain to process transactional information involving large numbers of consumers and consumer products. Product information is gathered that uniquely identifies a specific product by type and manufacturer and grouped into generic product clusters. Consumers are similarly grouped into consumer clusters based on common consumer demographics and other characteristics. Consumer retail transactions are analyzed in terms of product and/or consumer clusters to determine relationships between the consumers and the products. Product, consumer, and transactional data are maintained in a relational database. Targeting of specific consumers with marketing and other promotional literature is based on consumer buying habits, needs, demographics, etc. A retailer queries the database using selected criteria, accumulates data from the database in response to that query, and makes prudent business and marketing decisions based on that response. Queried information from the database may be communicated to a printing subsystem for printing promotional literature directed to particular customers based on cluster information stored in the database.},

  abstract = {We apply random graph modeling methodology to analyze bipartite consumer-product graphs that represent sales transactions to better understand consumer purchase behavior in e-commerce settings. Based on two real-world e-commerce data sets, we found that such graphs demonstrate topological features that deviate significantly from theoretical predictions based on standard random graph models. In particular, we observed consistently larger-than-expected average path lengths and a greater-than-expected tendency to cluster. Such deviations suggest that the consumers' product choices are not random even with the consumer and product attributes hidden. Our findings provide justification for a large family of collaborative filtering-based recommendation algorithms that make product recommendations based only on previous sales transactions. By analyzing the simulated consumer-product graphs generated by models that embed two representative recommendation algorithms, we found that these recommendation algorithm-induced graphs generally provided a better match with the real-world consumer-product graphs than purely random graphs. However, consistent deviations in topological features remained. These findings motivated the development of a new recommendation algorithm based on graph partitioning, which aims to achieve high clustering coefficients similar to those observed in the real-world e-commerce data sets. We show empirically that this algorithm significantly outperforms representative collaborative filtering algorithms in situations where the observed clustering coefficients of the consumer-product graphs are sufficiently larger than can be accounted for by these standard algorithms.},

Controlling for customer fixed effects and other variables, we find that grocery spending increases by \$1.59 when a \$10-off coupon is redeemed. The extra spending associated with coupon redemption is focused on groceries that a customer does not typically buy. These results are consistent with the theory of mental accounting but are not consistent with the standard permanent income or lifecycle theory of consumption. While the hypotheses we test are motivated by mental accounting, we also discuss some alternative psychological explanations for our findings.},

We recommend a retail data-driven approach that reveals a wealth of consumer shopping behavioral insights. We employ clustering techniques to segment the customer visits. The available customer visit segmentation studies view shoppers and their visits just as associations of product items. On the contrary, we discover patterns in the shoppers' shopping habits to comprehend the customers' behavior behind their visits and sales. Our approach segments customer visits and translates them to customer shopping behavior. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by applying it to real data provided by a Fortune 500 specialty retailer of home improvement and construction products. Apart from its theoretical contribution, our approach extracts knowledge that may support several decisions ranging from marketing campaigns per customer segment, redesign of store's layout to product recommendations.},

However, the confidence in simulation predictions and explanations is also tightly dependent on the ability of the model to integrate statistical knowledge and the situatedness of a retail store. In this paper, we propose a method for automatically retrieving prototypes of consumer behaviors from statistical measures based on real data (receipts). After preliminary experiments to validate this data mining process, we show how to populate a multiagent simulation with realistic agents, by initializing some of their goals with those prototypes. Endowed with the same overall behavior, validated in earlier experiments, those agents are put into a spatially realistic store. During the simulation, their actual actions reflect the diversity of real customers, and finally their purchase reproduce the original clusters. Besides, we explain how such statistically realistic simulation may be used to support decision in retail, and be extended to other application domains.},

  abstract = {During the past decade, rates of food insecurity and obesity have risen, and an association has been made between these two seemingly paradoxical states. Although this relationship has not been repeatedly seen in men, research suggests a correlation in women. Studies have not been able to consistently show a relationship in children, because findings differ based on age, race/ethnicity, household income, and sex. Several proposed hypotheses explain why a correlation between food insecurity and obesity exists in adults\textemdash{}especially women\textemdash{}but not in children. This review proposes a conceptual framework linking the Food Stamp Program and other coping strategies to the food insecurity\textendash{}obesity relationship. This link has implications for Food Stamp Program policy changes, welfare reform, and poverty prevention.},

  abstract = {One way in which to modify food purchases is to change prices through tax policy, subsidy policy, or both. We reviewed the growing body of experimental research conducted in the laboratory and in the field that investigates the following: the extent to which price changes influence purchases of targeted and nontargeted foods, total energy, or macronutrients purchased; the interaction of price changes with adjunctive interventions; and moderators of sensitivity to price changes. After a brief overview of economic principles and observational research that addresses these issues, we present a targeted review of experimental research. Experimental research suggests that price changes modify purchases of targeted foods, but research on the overall nutritional quality of purchases is mixed because of substitution effects. There is mixed support for combining price changes with adjunctive interventions, and there are no replicated findings on moderators to price sensitivity in experiments. Additional focused research is needed to better inform food policy development with the aim of improving eating behavior and preventing obesity.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.childyouth.2006.12.002},
  abstract = {This analysis summarizes trends in family economic well-being from five non-experimental, longitudinal welfare-to-work studies launched following the passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA). The studies include a sizable group of parents and other caregivers who received TANF at the point of sample selection or shortly thereafter, and share a wide range of similar measures of economic well-being. This analysis provides descriptive information on how these families are faring over time. Our results confirm what has been found by previous studies. Many families remain dependent on public benefits, and are either poor or near-poor, despite gains in some indicators of economic well-being. We caution that these aggregate statistics may mask important heterogeneity among families.},

We find that although nonwhites are sanctioned at lower rates than whites overall, nonwhites are sanctioned more compared to whites in each local area. This paradox occurs because nonwhites tend to live in areas with lower sanction rates. Consistent with the literature on race and policy, we find that sanction rates increase as the nonwhite population increases until a threshold is reached where nonwhites gain political power.},

The degree of this shrinkage is controlled by a tuning parameter $\lambda$ . It is shown that the class of estimators is asymptotically unbiased and Gaussian, when the individual effects are drawn from a class of zero-median distribution functions. The tuning parameter, $\lambda$ , can thus be selected to minimize estimated asymptotic variance. Monte Carlo evidence reveals that the estimator can significantly reduce the variability of the fixed-effect version of the estimator without introducing bias.},

Standard available methods are not appropriate for estimation of a censored QR model with a large number of parameters or with covariates correlated with unobserved individual heterogeneity. Motivated by these limitations, the article proposes estimators that are obtained by applying fixed effects QR to subsets of observations selected either parametrically or nonparametrically. We derive the limiting distribution of the new estimators under joint limits, and conduct Monte Carlo simulations to assess their small sample performance. An empirical application of the method to study the impact of the 1964 Civil Rights Act on the black\textendash{}white earnings gap is considered.

Moreover, it must be the case that low-income households would increase their spending on fruits and vegetables in response to an increase in their income. Using household data from the 2000 Consumer Expenditure Survey, a test of stochastic dominance is performed. Censored quantile regressions are also estimated at selected points of the conditional expenditure distribution. Low-income households are found to spend less on fruits and vegetables than other households, but they are not responsive to changes in income.},

Typically, all the factors that affect ecological processes are not measured and included in the statistical models used to investigate relationships between variables associated with those processes. As a consequence, there may be a weak or no predictive relationship between the mean of the response variable (y) distribution and the measured predictive factors (X). Yet there may be stronger, useful predictive relationships with other parts of the response variable distribution. This primer relates quantile regression estimates to prediction intervals in parametric error distribution regression models (eg least squares), and discusses the ordering characteristics, interval nature, sampling variation, weighting, and interpretation of the estimates for homogeneous and heterogeneous regression models.},

  abstract = {Many diseases are linked to dietary behavior. One major diet-related risk factor is a low consumption of vegetables. The consumption may be increased through public policies. The effects on vegetable purchases of either removing the value added tax on vegetables or a general income support are investigated. Adverse health effects are most serious in households consuming low quantities of vegetables. Therefore, the effects on high- and low-consuming households are estimated by using quantile regressions (QRs). Since many households did not purchase any vegetable during each survey period, censored as well as ordinary QRs are used. Our results suggest that the effects of the policy variables differ in different parts of the conditional distribution of vegetable purchases. None of the proposed policy options is likely to substantially increase vegetable purchases among low-consuming households. Bon nombre de maladies d{\'e}coulent des habitudes alimentaires. La faible consommation de l{\'e}gumes constitue un important facteur de risque li{\'e}{\`a} l'alimentation.

  abstract = {Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a technique of multivariate analysis used to approximate a given matrix containing non-negative data using two non-negative factor matrices that has been applied to a number of fields. However, when a matrix containing non-negative data has many zeroes, NMF encounters an approximation difficulty. This zero-inflated situation occurs often when a data matrix is given as count data, and becomes more challenging with matrices of increasing size. To solve this problem, we propose a new NMF model for zero-inflated non-negative matrices. Our model is based on the zero-inflated Tweedie distribution. The Tweedie distribution is a generalization of the normal, the Poisson, and the gamma distributions, and differs from each of the other distributions in the degree of robustness of its estimated parameters. In this paper, we show through numerical examples that the proposed model is superior to the basic NMF model in terms of approximation of zero-inflated data. Furthermore, we show the differences between the estimated basis vectors found using the basic and the proposed NMF models for $\beta\beta\backslash$beta divergence by applying it to real purchasing data.},

In this paper, we propose a framework for understanding how zero-inflated data sets originate and deciding how best to model them. We define and classify the different kinds of zeros that occur in ecological data and describe how they arise: either from `true zero' or `false zero' observations. After reviewing recent developments in modelling zero-inflated data sets, we use practical examples to demonstrate how failing to account for the source of zero inflation can reduce our ability to detect relationships in ecological data and at worst lead to incorrect inference. The adoption of methods that explicitly model the sources of zero observations will sharpen insights and improve the robustness of ecological analyses.},

  abstract = {We review statistical methods for analysing healthcare resource use and costs, their ability to address skewness, excess zeros, multimodality and heavy right tails, and their ease for general use. We aim to provide guidance on analysing resource use and costs focusing on randomised trials, although methods often have wider applicability. Twelve broad categories of methods were identified: (I) methods based on the normal distribution, (II) methods following transformation of data, (III) single-distribution generalized linear models (GLMs), (IV) parametric models based on skewed distributions outside the GLM family, (V) models based on mixtures of parametric distributions, (VI) two (or multi)-part and Tobit models, (VII) survival methods, (VIII) non-parametric methods, (IX) methods based on truncation or trimming of data, (X) data components models, (XI) methods based on averaging across models, and (XII) Markov chain methods. Based on this review, our recommendations are that, first, simple methods are preferred in large samples where the near-normality of sample means is assured. Second, in somewhat smaller samples, relatively simple methods, able to deal with one or two of above data characteristics, may be preferable but checking sensitivity to assumptions is necessary. Finally, some more complex methods hold promise, but are relatively untried; their implementation requires substantial expertise and they are not currently recommended for wider applied work.

  abstract = {Poisson regression is widely used in medical studies, and can be extended to negative binomial regression to allow for heterogeneity. When there is an excess number of zero counts, a useful approach is to used a mixture model with a proportion P of subjects not at risk, and a proportion of 1-P at-risk subjects who take on outcome values following a Poisson or negative binomial distribution. Covariate effects can be incorporated into both components of the models. In child assessment, fine motor development is often measured by test items that involve a process of imitation and a process of fine motor exercise. One such developmental milestone is `building a tower of cubes'. This study analyses the impact of foetal growth and postnatal somatic growth on this milestone, operationalized as the number of cubes and measured around the age of 22 months. It is shown that the two aspects of early growth may have different implications for imitation and fine motor dexterity. The usual approach of recording and analysing the milestone as a binary outcome, such as whether the child can build a tower of three cubes, may leave out important information.

  abstract = {We discuss a method for analyzing data that are positively skewed and contain a substantial proportion of zeros. Such data commonly arise in ecological applications, when the focus is on the abundance of a species. The form of the distribution is then due to the patchy nature of the environment and/or the inherent heterogeneity of the species. The method can be used whenever we wish to model the data as a response variable in terms of one or more explanatory variables. The analysis consists of three stages. The first involves creating two sets of data from the original: one shows whether or not the species is present; the other indicates the logarithm of the abundance when it is present. These are referred to as the `presence data' and the `log-abundance' data, respectively. The second stage involves modelling the presence data using logistic regression, and separately modelling the log-abundance data using ordinary regression. Finally, the third stage involves combining the two models in order to estimate the expected abundance for a specific set of values of the explanatory variables. A common approach to analyzing this sort of data is to use a ln (y+c) transformation, where c is some constant (usually one). The method we use here avoids the need for an arbitrary choice of the value of c, and allows the modelling to be carried out in a natural and straightforward manner, using well-known regression techniques. The approach we put forward is not original, having been used in both conservation biology and fisheries. Our objectives in this paper are to (a) promote the application of this approach in a wide range of settings and (b) suggest that parametric bootstrapping be used to provide confidence limits for the estimate of expected abundance.},

Using data from the Spanish Family Expenditure Survey (EPF), Tobit, P-Tobit and first hurdle dominance models are shown to be restrictive. This dataset also confirms the existence of separate individual decisions on participation and consumption. We propose to estimate a dependent version of a double-hurdle model, although independence is not restrictive once additional powers of total expenditure are included in the specification of the second hurdle. Several misspecification tests are also conducted among the different models.},

  abstract = {The nonlinear fixed effects models in econometrics has often been avoided for two reasons one practical, one methodological. The practical obstacle relates to the difficulty of estimating nonlinear models with possibly thousands of coefficients. In fact, in a large number of models of interest to practitioners, estimation of the fixed effects model is feasible even in panels with very large numbers of groups. The more difficult, methodological question centers on the incidental parameters problem that raises questions about the statistical properties of the estimator. There is very little empirical evidence on the behavior of the fixed effects estimator. In this note, we use Monte Carlo methods to examine the small sample bias in the binary probit and logit models, the ordered probit model, the tobit model, the Poisson regression model for count data and the exponential regression model for a nonnegative random variable. We find three results of note: A widely accepted result that suggests that the probit estimator is actually relatively well behaved appears to be incorrect. Perhaps to some surprise, the tobit model, unlike the others, appears largely to be unaffected by the incidental parameters problem, save for a surprising result related to the disturbance variance estimator. Third, as apparently unexamined previously, the estimated asymptotic estimators for fixed effects estimators appear uniformly to be downward biased.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.jand.2011.12.021},
  abstract = {Background
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (formerly Food Stamp Program) participants can use their benefits at many farmers' markets. However, most markets have only one market-operated wireless point-of-sale (POS) card swipe terminal for electronic benefits transfer (EBT) transactions. It is not known whether providing each farmer/vendor with individual wireless POS terminals and subsidizing EBT fees will increase SNAP/EBT purchases at farmers' markets.
Objective
To evaluate the effects of multiple vendor-operated wireless POS terminals (vs a single market-operated terminal) on use of SNAP benefits at an urban farmers' market.
Design
Time-series analyses of SNAP/EBT sales.
Setting
The Clark Park farmers' market in West Philadelphia, PA, which accounts for one quarter of all SNAP/EBT sales at farmers' markets in Pennsylvania.
Intervention
Vendors were provided with individual wireless POS terminals for 9 months (June 2008-February 2009.) The pilot program covered all equipment and wireless service costs and transaction fees associated with SNAP/EBT, credit, and debit sales.
Main outcome measure
Monthly SNAP/EBT sales at the Clark Park farmers' market.
Statistical analyses
SNAP/EBT sales data were collected for 48 months (January 2007-December 2010). Time-series regression analysis was used to estimate the effect of the intervention period (June 2008-February 2009) on SNAP/EBT sales, controlling for seasonal effects and total SNAP benefits issued in Philadelphia.
Results
The intervention was associated with a 38\% increase in monthly SNAP/EBT sales. Effects were greatest during the busy fall market seasons. SNAP/EBT sales did not remain significantly higher after the intervention period.
Conclusions
Providing individual wireless POS terminals to farmers' market vendors leads to increased sales. However, market vendors indicated that subsidies for equipment costs and fees would be needed to break even. Currently, SNAP provides some support for these services for supermarket and other SNAP retailers with landline access, but not for farmers' markets.},

  abstract = {Introduction
Increased acceptance of nutrition benefits at farmers markets could improve access to nutritious foods for low-income shoppers. The objective of this study was to evaluate a pilot project to increase participation by farmers markets and their vendors in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).

Methods
The intervention targeted 9 markets in lower-income regions of King County, Washington. Markets and vendors were offered subsidized electronic benefits transfer (EBT) terminals for processing SNAP, and vendors could apply to accept WIC cash value vouchers. WIC staff received information on using SNAP and vouchers at farmers markets. We used mixed methods post-implementation to measure participation, describe factors in acceptance of benefits, and assess information needs for WIC staff to conduct effective outreach.

Results
Of approximately 88 WIC-eligible vendors, 38 agreed to accept vouchers. Ten of 125 vendors installed an EBT terminal, and 6 markets installed a central market terminal. The number of market stalls accepting SNAP increased from 80 to 143, an increase of 79\%. Participating vendors wanted to provide access to SNAP and WIC shoppers, although redemption rates were low. Some WIC staff members were unfamiliar with markets, which hindered outreach.

Conclusion
Vendors and markets value low-income shoppers and, when offered support, will take on some inconvenience to serve them. To improve participation and sustainability, we recommend ongoing subsidies and streamlined procedures better suited to meet markets' capabilities. Low EBT redemption rates at farmers markets suggest a need for more outreach to low-income shoppers and relationship building with WIC staff.},

  abstract = {The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (formerly the Food Stamp Program) is the Nation's largest nutritional assistance program and the cornerstone of Federal Government efforts to alleviate hunger in the United States and its territories. SNAP benefits are funded by the United States Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). They are issued by individual States and redeemable at any authorized FNS SNAP retailer, which includes an increasing number of farmers markets. SNAP benefits are accessed via an Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card that is processed using electronic funds transfer technology. EBT cards look and operate like bank-issued debit cards. SNAP benefits are accessed by swiping the EBT card on a point-of-sale (POS) terminal at an FNS retailer location and entering a personal identification number (PIN). FNS SNAP retailers can either use EBT-only machines, which look like standard commercial POS terminals and are provided for free by FNS, or supply their own terminals. EBT-only machines require electricity and a phone line connection, and accepts only EBT cards. Many FNS SNAP retailers choose to pay for commercial POS terminals that accept EBT, debit, and credit cards on the same machine. Electrical hookups and phone line connections are not available at many farmers market sites, preventing the use of the free EBT-only machines. Even when market managers and vendors are willing and able to invest in wireless POS terminals, the technology can be difficult to manage and promote at farmers markets. Operating an EBT machine requires an FNS license. FNS allows markets to obtain a single FNS license for all eligible vendors at the market. SNAP benefits are redeemed using one centrally located POS terminal; transactions are processed throughout the farmers markets using scrip (paper certificates, tokens, or receipts). SNAP customers redeem their benefits by swiping their EBT cards at the POS terminal in exchange for scrip, which they can use to buy eligible food products. This process is similar to one sometimes used for accepting credit and debit cards at farmers markets. While it is possible for individual vendors to have their own FNS license and POS terminal, scrip projects are the most common way for farmers markets to accept SNAP benefits. This handbook is a how-to guide for accepting SNAP benefits at farmers markets. Topics include why to accept SNAP benefits, how to install EBT systems at farmers markets, how to use scrip projects to accept SNAP benefits at farmers markets, how to become an FNS snap retailer, what equipment is required to accept SNAP benefits at farmers markets, and how to make SNAP EBT succeed at farmers markets.},

We show that controlling for such factors by including country fixed effects removes the statistical association between income per capita and various measures of democracy. We present instrumental-variables estimates that also show no causal effect of income on democracy. The cross-country correlation between income and democracy reflects a positive correlation between changes in income and democracy over the past 500 years. This pattern is consistent with the idea that societies embarked on divergent political-economic development paths at certain critical junctures.},

Although much research to date has focused on the prediction of the conditional mean cost, this can potentially miss important features of the full distribution such as tail probabilities. We conduct a quasi-Monte Carlo experiment using the English National Health Service inpatient data to compare 14 approaches in modelling the distribution of healthcare costs: nine of which are parametric and have commonly been used to fit healthcare costs, and five others are designed specifically to construct a counterfactual distribution. Our results indicate that no one method is clearly dominant and that there is a trade-off between bias and precision of tail probability forecasts. We find that distributional methods demonstrate significant potential, particularly with larger sample sizes where the variability of predictions is reduced. Parametric distributions such as log-normal, generalised gamma and generalised beta of the second kind are found to estimate tail probabilities with high precision but with varying bias depending upon the cost threshold being considered.},

We evaluated whether a brief, universal, postnatal nurse home-visiting intervention can be implemented with high penetration and fidelity, prevent emergency health care services, and promote positive parenting by infant age 6 months.Methods. Durham Connects is a manualized 4- to 7-session program to assess family needs and connect parents with community resources to improve infant health and well-being. All 4777 resident births in Durham, North Carolina, between July 1, 2009, and December 31, 2010, were randomly assigned to intervention and control conditions. A random, representative subset of 549 families received blinded interviews for impact evaluation.Results. Of all families, 80\% initiated participation; adherence was 84\%. Hospital records indicated that Durham Connects infants had 59\% fewer infant emergency medical care episodes than did control infants. Durham Connects mothers reported fewer infant emergency care episodes and more community connections, more positive parenting behaviors, participation in higher quality out-of-home child care, and lower rates of anxiety than control mothers. Blinded observers reported higher quality home environments for Durham Connects than for control families.Conclusions. A brief universal home-visiting program implemented with high penetration and fidelity can lower costly emergency medical care and improve family outcomes.},

Within this context it becomes important to test the statistical exogeneity of appliance dummy variables typically included in demand for electricity equations. If, as the theory would suggest, the demand for durables and their use are related decisions by the consumer, specifications which ignore this fact will lead to biased and inconsistent estimates of price and income elasticities. The present paper attempts to test this bias using a subsample of the 1975 survey of 3249 households carried out by the Washington Center for Metropolitan Studies (WCMS) for the Federal Energy Administration. We discuss and derive a unified model of the demand for consumer durables and the derived demand for electricity. To determine the magnitude of the bias resulting from estimating a unit electricity consumption (UEC) equation by ordinary least squares when unobserved factors influence both choice of appliances and intensity of use, we introduce and estimate a joint water-heat space-heat choice model, and conclude with the consistent estimation and specification of demand for electricity equations.},

Our study deployed a Stated Preference survey to measure consumers' potential responses towards price changes and the introduction of promotions, as well as the resulting effects on demand. A series of econometric models were developed, ranging from simple selection models to advanced multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) models, to capture the discrete and continuous feature of alcohol purchasing choice behaviour. The model results were compared and then extrapolated to a series of policy scenario tests, to enable the evaluation of factors that underpin consumers' alcohol purchasing behaviour. This research contributes to evidence on the role of multi-buy promotions on alcohol purchasing behaviour, as well as adding to recent developments in the choice modelling literature by providing a comparison of results across a range of different model structures suitable for the analysis of data such as used here.},

  abstract = {Understanding the effect of temporary price reductions, or price promotions, on sales of consumer packaged goods is an area of ongoing interest, both in academia and in practice. Price promotions, however, are becoming an increasingly important method of managing consumer demand for fresh produce items. Modeling the impact of price promotions must take into account the differentiated nature of fresh produce and the fact that consumers tend to purchase multiple items of only a few of the products available to them. Neither a continuous nor a discrete model of demand is appropriate. In this paper, we apply a multiple-discrete/continuous model of fresh produce demand to study the impact of price promotion on retail apple sales. Our findings show that the brand switching/category incidence effect of promotion is closer to 65/35 than the more usual 80/20 rule (80 percent of the effect is brand switching and 20 percent purchase incidence) when the nature of the decision is appropriately taken into consideration.},

  abstract = {Several consumer demand choices are characterized by the choice of multiple alternatives simultaneously. An example of such a choice situation in activity-travel analysis is the type of discretionary (or leisure) activity to participate in and the duration of time investment of the participation. In this context, within a given temporal period (say a day or a week), an individual may decide to participate in multiple types of activities (for example, in-home social activities, out-of-home social activities, in-home recreational activities, out-of-home recreational activities, and out-of-home non-maintenance shopping activities).
In this paper, we derive and formulate a utility theory-based model for discrete/continuous choice that assumes diminishing marginal utility as the level of consumption of any particular alternative increases (i.e., satiation). This assumption yields a multiple discreteness model (i.e., choice of multiple alternatives can occur simultaneously). This is in contrast to the standard discrete choice model that is based on assuming the absence of any diminishing marginal utility as the level of consumption of any alternative increases (i.e., no satiation), leading to the case of strictly single discreteness. The econometric model formulated here, which we refer to as the multiple discrete\textendash{}continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model, has a surprisingly simple and elegant closed form expression for the discrete\textendash{}continuous probability of not consuming certain alternatives and consuming given levels of the remaining alternatives. To our knowledge, we are the first to develop such a simple and powerful closed-form model for multiple discreteness in the literature. This formulation should constitute an important milestone in the area of multiple discreteness, just as the multinomial logit (MNL) represented an important milestone in the area of single discreteness. Further, the MDCEV model formulated here has the appealing property that it collapses to the familiar multinomial logit (MNL) choice model in the case of single discreteness. Finally, heteroscedasticity and/or correlation in unobserved characteristics affecting the demand of different alternatives can be easily incorporated within the MDCEV model framework using a mixing approach.
The MDCEV model and its mixed variant are applied to analyze time-use allocation decisions among a variety of discretionary activities on weekends using data from the 2000 San Francisco Bay Area survey.},

In addition to deriving the general form, the paper derives a compact and readily usable form of consumption probability expressions that can be used to estimate multiple discrete-continuous choice models with general cross-nested error structures.
The cross-nested version of the MDCGEV model is applied to analyze household annual expenditure patterns in various transportation-related expenses using data from a Consumer Expenditure Survey in the United States. Model estimation results and predictive log-likelihood based validation tests indicate the superiority of the cross-nested model over the mutually exclusively nested and non-nested model specifications. Further, the cross-nested model was amenable to the accommodation of socio-demographic heterogeneity in inter-alternative covariance across decision-makers through a parameterization of the allocation parameters.},

The MDCNEV model is applied to analyze non-worker out-of-home discretionary activity time-use and activity timing decisions on weekdays using data from the 2000 San Francisco Bay Area data. This empirical application contributes to the literature on activity time-use and activity timing analysis by considering daily activity time-use behavior and activity timing preferences in a unified utility maximization-based framework. The model estimation results provide several insights into the determinants of non-workers' activity time-use and timing decisions. The MDCNEV model performs better than the MDCEV model in terms of goodness of fit. However, the nesting parameters are very close to 1, indicating low levels of correlation. Nonetheless, even with such low correlation levels, empirical policy simulations indicate non-negligible differences in policy predictions and substitution patterns exhibited by the two models. Experiments conducted using simulated data also corroborate this result.},

  abstract = {Multiple-discrete continuous choice models formulated and applied in recent years consider a single linear resource constraint, which, when combined with consumer preferences, determines the optimal consumption point. However, in reality, consumers face multiple resource constraints such as those associated with time, money, and capacity. Ignoring such multiple constraints and instead using a single constraint can, and in general will, lead to poor data fit and inconsistent preference estimation, which can then have a serious negative downstream effect on forecasting and welfare/policy analysis.
In this paper, we extend the multiple-discrete continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model to accommodate multiple constraints. The formulation uses a flexible and general utility function form, and is applicable to the case of complete demand systems as well as incomplete demand systems. The proposed MC-MDCEV model is applied to time-use decisions, where individuals are assumed to maximize their utility from time-use in one or more activities subject to monetary and time availability constraints. The sample for the empirical exercise is generated by combining time-use information from the 2008 American Time Use Survey and expenditure records from the 2008 US Consumer Expenditure Survey. The estimation results show that preferences can get severely mis-estimated, and the data fit can degrade substantially, when only a subset of active resource constraints is used.},

  title = {On Generalizing the Multiple Discrete-Continuous Extreme Value ({{MDCEV}}) Model},
  abstract = {The overall goal of the dissertation is to contribute to the growing literature on multiple discrete-continuous (MDC) choice models. In MDC choice situations, consumers often encounter two inter-related decisions at a choice instance \textendash{} which alternative(s) to choose for consumption from a set of available alternatives, and the amount to consume of the chosen alternatives. In the recent literature, there is increasing attention on modeling MDC situations based on a rigorous underlying micro-economic utility maximization framework. Among these models, the multiple-discrete continuous extreme value MDCEV model (Bhat, 2005, 2008) provides a number of advantages over other models. The primary objective of this dissertation is to extend the MDCEV framework to accommodate more realistic decision-making processes from a behavioral standpoint. The dissertation has two secondary objectives. The first is to advance the current operationalization and the econometric modeling of MDC choice situations. The second is to contribute to the transportation literature by estimating MDC models that provide new insights on individuals' travel decision processes.

The proposed extensions of the MDCEV model include: (1) To formulate and estimate a latent choice set generation model within the MDCEV framework, (2) To develop a random utility-based model formulation that extends the MDCEV model to include multiple linear constraints, and (3) To extend the MDCEV model to relax the assumption of an additively separable utility function. The methodologies developed in this dissertation allow the specification and estimation of complex MDC choice models, and may be viewed as a major advance with the potential to lead to significant breakthroughs in the way MDC choices are structured and implemented. These methodologies provide a more realistic representation of the choice process. The proposed extensions are applied to different empirical contexts within the transportation field, including participation in and travel mileage allocated to non-work activities during various time periods of the day for workers, participation in recreational activities and time allocation for workers, and household expenditures in disaggregate transportation categories. The results from these exercises clearly underline the importance of relaxing some of the assumptions made, not only in the MDCEV model, but in MDC models in general.},

  shorttitle = {The "{{Shopping Basket}}"},
  abstract = {Consumers make multicategory decisions in a variety of contexts such as choice of multiple categories during a shopping trip or mail-order purchasing. The choice of one category may affect the selection of another category due to the complementary nature (e.g., cake mix and cake frosting) of the two categories. Alternatively, two categories may co-occur in a shopping basket not because they are complementary but because of similar purchase cycles (e.g., beer and diapers) or because of a host of other unobserved factors. While complementarity gives managers some control over consumers' buying behavior (e.g., a change in the price of cake mix could change the purchase probability of cake frosting), co-occurrence or co-incidence is less controllable. Other factors that may affect multi-category choice may be (unobserved) household preferences or (observed) household demographics. We also argue that not accounting for these three factors simultaneously could lead to erroneous inferences. We then develop a conceptual framework that incorporates complementarity, co-incidence and heterogeneity (both observed and unobserved) as the factors that could lead to multicategory choice. We then translate this framework into a model of multicategory choice. Our model is based on random utility theory and allows for simultaneous, interdependent choice of many items. This model, the multivariate probit model, is implemented in a Hierarchical Bayes framework. The hierarchy consists of three levels. The first level captures the choice of items for the shopping basket during a shopping trip. The second level captures differences across households and the third level specifies the priors for the unknown parameters. We generalize some recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in order to estimate the model. Specifically, we use a substitution sampler which incorporates techniques such as the Metropolis Hit-and-Run algorithm and the Gibbs Sampler. The model is estimated on four categories (cake mix, cake frosting, fabric detergent and fabric softener) using multicategory panel data. The results disentangle the complementarity and co-incidence effects. The complementarity results show that pricing and promotional changes in one category affect purchase incidence in related product categories. In general, the cross-price and cross-promotion effects are smaller than the own-price and own-promotions effects. The cross-effects are also asymmetric across pairs of categories, i.e., related category pairs may be characterized as having a "primary" and a "secondary" category. Thus these results provide a more complete description of the effects of promotional changes by examining them both within and across categories. The co-incidence results show the extent of the relationship between categories that arises from uncontrollable and unobserved factors. These results are useful since they provide insights into a general structure of dependence relationships across categories. The heterogeneity results show that observed demographic factors such as family size influence the intrinsic category preference of households. Larger family sizes also tend to make households more price sensitive for both the primary and secondary categories. We find that price sensitivities across categories are not highly correlated at the household level. We also find some evidence that intrinsic preferences for cake mix and cake frosting are more closely related than preferences for fabric detergent and fabric softener. We compare our model with a series of null models using both estimation and holdout samples. We show that both complementarity and co-incidence play a significant role in predicting multicategory choice. We also show how many single-category models used in conjunction may not be good predictors of joint choice. Our results are likely to be of interest to retailers and manufacturers trying to optimize pricing and promotion strategies across many categories as well as in designing micromarketing strategies. We illustrate some of these benefits by carrying out an analysis which shows that the "true" impact of complementarity and co-incidence on profitability is significant in a retail setting. Our model can also be applied to other domains. The combination of item interdependence and individual household level estimates may be of particular interest to database marketers in building customized "cross-selling" strategies in the direct mail and financial service industries.},

  abstract = {We examine an alternative method to incorporate potential presence of population heterogeneity within the Multiple Discrete Continuous Extreme Value (MDCEV) model structure. Towards this end, an endogenous segmentation approach is proposed that allocates decision makers probabilistically to various segments as a function of exogenous variables. Within each endogenously determined segment, a segment specific MDCEV model is estimated. This approach provides insights on the various population segments present while evaluating distinct choice regimes for each of these segments. The segmentation approach addresses two concerns: (1) ensures that the parameters are estimated employing the full sample for each segment while using all the population records for model estimation, and (2) provides valuable insights on how the exogenous variables affect segmentation. An Expectation\textendash{}Maximization algorithm is proposed to address the challenges of estimating the resulting endogenous segmentation based econometric model. A prediction procedure to employ the estimated latent MDCEV models for forecasting is also developed. The proposed model is estimated using data from 2009 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) for the New York region. The results of the model estimates and prediction exercises illustrate the benefits of employing an endogenous segmentation based MDCEV model. The challenges associated with the estimation of latent MDCEV models are also documented.},

The MPCF out of cash is much smaller. These patterns obtain even for households for whom SNAP benefits are economically equivalent to cash in the sense that benefits do not cover all food spending. We reject the hypothesis that households respect the fungibility of money in a semiparametric setup. A post-hoc model of mental accounting rationalizes these facts and others.},

  abstract = {Discrete choice models are well suited to describing consumer choice. However, conventional discrete choice models depart from standard utility maximization models in two important respects. First, in typical discrete choice models, the total demand for a choice set is exogenously fixed. Second, conventional discrete choice models have a limited ability to describe the unrestricted substitutionary or complementary relationships between multiple categories of goods. Both suggest that conventional discrete choice models correspond to a special utility maximization problem that we can develop to incorporate endogenous change in the total demand for a choice set and multiple categories of goods in an unrestrictive way. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the theoretical foundation of such discrete choice models in the context of standard deterministic utility maximization, derive the elasticities of the implied demand functions, and obtain a method for the calculation of welfare change. The framework in this paper is most useful for considering complementary relationships across categories, which is generally intractable in conventional discrete choice models in the absence of restrictive assumptions. The analysis demonstrates that the results of discrete choice models are perfectly consistent with standard deterministic utility maximization, even if the total demand for a choice set changes endogenously or with multiple categories of goods. Thus, discrete choice models are intrinsically more applicable across a much broader range of consumer choices.},

Consequently, it is important to accurately predict the vehicle holdings of households as well as the vehicle miles of travel by vehicle type to project future traffic congestion and mobile source emission levels. In this paper, we apply a multiple discrete-continuous extreme value model to analyze the holdings and use of multiple vehicle types by households. Data for the analysis is drawn from a 2000 San Francisco Bay Area survey. The model results indicate the important effects of household demographics, residence location variables and vehicle attributes on vehicle type holdings and use. The model developed in the paper can be applied to predict the impact of demographic, land use, and operating cost changes on vehicle type holdings and usage. Such predictions are important at a time when the household demographic characteristics are changing rapidly in the United States. The predictions can also inform the design of proactive land-use, economic, and transportation policies to influence household vehicle holdings and usage in a way that reduces traffic congestion and air quality problems.},

This paper proposes a randomized and scrambled version of the Halton sequence for use in simulation estimation of discrete choice models. The scrambling of the Halton sequence is motivated by the rapid deterioration of the standard Halton sequence's coverage of the integration domain in high dimensions of integration. The randomization of the sequence is motivated from a need to statistically compute the simulation variance of model parameters. The resulting hybrid sequence combines the good coverage property of quasi-Monte Carlo sequences with the ease of estimating simulation error using traditional Monte Carlo methods. The paper develops an evaluation framework for assessing the performance of the traditional pseudo-random sequence, the standard Halton sequence, and the scrambled Halton sequence. The results of computational experiments indicate that the scrambled Halton sequence performs better than the standard Halton sequence and the traditional pseudo-random sequence for simulation estimation of models with high dimensionality of integration.},

  abstract = {In many countries, there are few or no panel data, but there exists a series of independent cross-sections. For example, in the United Kingdom, there are no panel data on consumers' expenditure or on household labor supply, but there are several large household surveys carried out every year. Samples for these surveys are drawn anew each year, so that it is impossible to track individual households over time. This paper considers the possibility of tracking `cohorts' through such data. A `cohort' is defined as a group with fixed membership, individuals of which can be identified as they show up in the surveys. The most obvious example is an age cohort, e.g. all males born between 1945 and 1950, but there are other possibilities (Korean war veterans or founding members of the Econometric Society). Consider any economic relationship of interest that is linear in parameters (but not necessarily in variables). Corresponding to individual behavior, there will exist a cohort version of the relationship of the same form, but with cohort means replacing individual observations. If there are additive individual fixed effects, there will be corresponding additive cohort fixed effects. Further, the sample cohort means from the surveys are consistent but error-ridden estimates of the true cohort means. Hence, provided errors-in-variables techniques are used (and error variances and covariances can be estimated from the surveys), the sample cohort means can be used as panel data for estimating the relationship. Such data are immune to attrition bias and can be extended for long time periods. There is also evidence to suggest that the errors in variables problems may be just as severe for genuine panel data; in the created panels considered here, the problem is controllable. The paper discusses appropriate errors in variables estimators, with and without fixed effects.},

Several authors argue that such parameters can also be identified from repeated cross-section data and present estimators to do so. This paper reviews the identification conditions underlying these estimators. As grouping data to obtain a pseudo-panel is an application of instrumental variables (IV), identification requires that standard IV conditions are met. This paper explicitly discusses the implications of these conditions for empirical analyses. We also propose a computationally attractive IV estimator that is consistent under essentially the same conditions as existing estimators. While a Monte Carlo study indicates that this estimator may work well under relatively weak conditions, these conditions are not trivially satisfied in applied work. Accordingly, a key conclusion of the paper is that these estimators cannot be implemented under general conditions.},

It is demonstrated here that the parameters of such models, both linear and nonlinear, both with and without fixed individual effects, are identified and can be consistently estimated with the imposition of certain restrictions. The paper includes an examination of the identification and estimation with repeated cross-sectional data of dynamic discrete dependent variable models, which can be parameterized in terms of transition rates between the different cross-sections.},

The main results of the paper consist in defining sufficient conditions under which allocations in the $<$tex-math$>$\$$\backslash$scr\{I\}\^\{2\}$\backslash$text\{-core\}\$$<$/tex-math$>$ have a competitive restriction to the atomless sector, and vice versa.

Through numerical experiments and reanalysis of data from a study by Romer and Snyder (1994), we illustrate the consequences of using the standard Tobit model, which assumes a censoring point at zero, when the zeros are not due to censoring mechanisms or when actual censoring is not at zero. In the latter case, we also show that Greene's (1981) well-known results on the direction and size of the bias of the OLS estimator in the standard Tobit model do not necessarily hold. Because the Heckit model is often used as an alternative to Tobit, we examine its assumptions and discuss the proper interpretation of the Heckit/Tobit estimation results using Grier and co-workers' (1994) Heckit model of campaign contribution data. Sensitivity analyses of the Heckit estimation results suggest some conclusions rather different from those reached by Grier et al.},

First, many articles invoke the Heckit to solve a supposed selection problem associated with masses of zero values in continuous variables, despite the fact that it has been shown elsewhere that no such selection problem exists when modeling observed actual, as opposed to latent potential, outcomes. Second, many applications incorrectly formulate the marginal effect tests in the Heckit and two-part model, thus undermining central conclusions. Finally, many researchers use a t-test of the inverse Mills coefficient to choose between the Heckit and two-part models despite its poor performance; we propose instead an adapted empirical mean square error test.

The primary contribution of this study is to develop a practical and efficient sampling scheme for the conditional posterior distributions of the censored (i.e., unobserved) data, so that the Gibbs sampler with the data augmentation algorithm is successfully applied. The substantial differences between this approach and some existing methods are highlighted. The proposed simulation method is investigated by means of a Monte Carlo study and applied to a regression model of Japanese exports of passenger cars to the U.S. subject to a non-tariff trade barrier.},

The sample selection estimators include LIML and FIML. The two-part estimators include a naive (the true specification, omitting the correlation coefficient) and a data-analytic (testimator) variant. In the absence of exclusion restrictions, the two-part models are no worse, and often appreciably better than selection models in terms of mean behavior, but can behave poorly for extreme values of the independent variable. LIML had the worst performance of all four models. Empirically, selection effects are difficult to distinguish from a non-linear (e.g., quadratic) response. With exclusion restrictions, simple selection models were significantly better behaved than a naive two-part model over subranges of the data, but were negligibly better than the data-analytic version.},

Recent Monte Carlo studies by Hay, Leu, and Rohrer (1987) and Manning, Duan, and Rogers (1987) find that the two-part model performs better than the sample selection model even when the latter is the true model. We show that Manning, Duan, and Rogers' negative results regarding the sample selection model are caused by a critical design problem. We demonstrate that their data generating process produces serious collinearity problems that bias against the sample selection model. Once the design problem is rectified, the poor performance of the sample selection model evaporates. Our Monte Carlo results offer a more balanced view on the relative merits of the two models as each model performs well under different conditions. In particular, the sample selection model is susceptible to collinearity problems and a t-test can be used to distinguish between the two models as long as there are no collinearity problems. As an example, we employ Mroz's (1987) labor supply data to illustrate how his tests for selectivity bias might have been affected by collinearity problems.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.trb.2005.08.004},
  abstract = {This paper formulates a model for the joint analysis of the imperfect and perfect substitute goods case. That is, it enables the modeling of choice situations where consumers choose multiple alternatives at the same time from a certain set of alternatives, but also choose only one alternative from among a subset of alternatives. For example, in the context of time-use in leisure activity, individuals may participate in combinations of social, out-of-home recreation, and out-of-home non-maintenance shopping pursuits. These three activity types are imperfect substitutes in that they serve different functional needs of individuals and households. However, if an individual participates in out-of-home recreation, s/he may participate in only one of physically passive activities (for example, going to the movies), partially physically active activities (going to the beach or participating in spectator sports), or physically active activities (for example, working out at a gym) during a given time period (such as a weekday or a weekend day). To our knowledge, this paper is the first to consider a unified utility-maximizing framework for the analysis of such a joint imperfect\textendash{}perfect substitute goods case in the economic literature.
The model formulated in the paper is applied to the time-use decisions of individuals. Specifically, individual time-use in maintenance and leisure activities are modeled as a function of demographic variables, urban environment attributes, and day of week/season effects. The results from the model can be used to examine time-use choices across different segments of the population (for example, male vs. female, young vs. old, etc.), as well as to assess the potential impact of urban form policies on individual time-use decisions.},

Take-up rates in different countries and in different programs range between 80\% and only 25\%. This paper reviews the main empirical studies of welfare participation, identifying the individual or household characteristics associated with different levels of participation in welfare programs. We conclude that low take-up rates cannot be satisfactorily explained by lack of information or by heavy transaction costs. In fact, there is some evidence that the psychological cost of claiming benefits, also known as welfare stigma, is probably the main determinant of low take-up rates. The decision not to take-up welfare benefits can be modeled as a rational, utility-maximising decision. The second part of this paper reviews the few contributions to an economic theory of welfare stigma and proposes some areas for future research on welfare take-up.},

Expectations of poor treatment when applying for Medicaid, enrollment barriers, and misinformation about program rules were also associated with reduced Medicaid enrollment. States that enacted strict welfare reform policies were potentially decreasing TANF participation, while states with more simplified and generous programs were potentially increasing Medicaid participation. The results suggest that the image of the adult Medicaid program remains tied to perceptions about welfare and provides guidance to policymakers about how to improve participation rates.},

This consensus has lately been questioned by researchers who point out that most WIC research fails to properly control for selection into the program. This paper evaluates the selection problem using rich data from the national Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. We show that relative to Medicaid mothers, all of whom are eligible for WIC, WIC participants are negatively selected on a wide array of observable dimensions, and yet WIC participation is associated with improved birth outcomes, even after controlling for observables and for a full set of state-year interactions intended to capture unobservables that vary at the state-year level. The positive impacts of WIC are larger among subsets of even more disadvantaged women, such as those who received public assistance last year, single high school dropouts, and teen mothers. \textcopyright{} 2005 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.},

METHODS: Mothers were randomly assigned to either a nurse-visited (n = 236) or a paraprofessional-visited (n = 244) condition. Nurse- and paraprofessional-visited families were compared on number and length of visits, topics covered, number of program dropouts, and relationship with home visitor. RESULTS: On average, nurses completed more visits than paraprofessionals (28 vs 23; P $<$ .001) and spent a greater proportion of time on physical health issues during pregnancy (38\% vs 27\%; P $<$ .001) and on parenting issues during infancy (46\% vs 32\%; P $<$ .001). Paraprofessionals conducted visits that lasted longer and spent a greater proportion of time on environmental health and safety issues (15\% vs 7\% pregnancy; 15\% vs 8\% infancy; P $<$ .001). While home visitors were viewed equally positively by mothers, nurses had fewer dropouts than did paraprofessionals (38\% vs 48\%; P = .04). More paraprofessional-visited families than nurse-visited families experienced staff turnover. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses and paraprofessionals, even when using the same model, provide home visiting services in different ways.},

Focus group transcripts were analyzed to identify themes regarding perinatal depression coping strategies, preferred approaches to treating perinatal depression, and recommendations for engaging perinatal Latinas in treatment. The results suggest that Latinas' treatment preferences consist of a pathway (i.e., hierarchical) approach that begins with the use of one's own resources, followed by the use of formal support systems (e.g., home-visiting nurse), and supplemented with the use of behavioral therapy. Antidepressant use was judged to be acceptable only in severe cases or after delivery. The data indicate that to increase health-seeking behaviors among perinatal Latinas, practitioners should first build trust.},

Our study explores and describes mothers' experiences participating in the Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) Program, an intensive home visiting program with demonstrated effectiveness, from the time of program entry before 29 weeks gestation until their infant's first birthday. A qualitative case study approach was implemented. A purposeful sample of 18 low income, young first time mothers participating in a pilot study of the NFP program in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada partook in one to two face to face in-depth interviews exploring their experiences in the program. All interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Conventional content analysis procedures were used to analyze all interviews. Data collection and initial analysis were implemented concurrently. The mothers participating in the NFP program were very positive about their experiences in the program. Three overarching themes emerged from the data: 1. Getting into the NFP program; 2. The NFP nurse is an expert, but also like a friend providing support; and 3. Participating in the NFP program is making me a better parent. Our findings provide vital information to home visiting nurses and to planners of home visiting programs about mothers' perspectives on what is important to them in their relationships with their nurses, how nurses and women are able to develop positive therapeutic relationships, and how nurses respond to mothers' unique life situations while home visiting within the NFP Program. In addition our findings offer insights into why and under what circumstances low income mothers will engage in nurse home visiting and how they expect to benefit from their participation.},

A nation-wide postal questionnaire sent to 800 first-time mothers yielded the data for statistical analysis. Data were collected using a modified version of the questionnaire ``Quality of Care from the Patient's Perspective'', the part concerning child healthcare. The results showed that mothers who had received home visits were more content with the encounter than were mothers who had to visit the clinic. This particularly concerned advice on breastfeeding, being able to talk to the nurse in peace and quiet, and the fact that the nurse took time and was personal. In contrast, the mothers who had received a home visit were less content with the competence of the nurse when she examined the child. Mothers of low SEC were less satisfied with the first encounter than were mothers of high/middle SEC with regard to several points. Conclusion: Home visits were shown to have advantages over visits to the clinic. Mothers of low SEC were less satisfied with the first encounter with the nurse than were mothers in the high/ middle SEC.},

Objective:  Research is essential for guiding public health nursing practice with low-income and/or minority populations. Despite this, little is known about fundamental recruitment problems, the degree to which the informed consent process is comprehended, or how critical a role trust may play in conducting successful research with these groups. This article describes factors influencing recruitment of underrepresented groups, preferences for the informed consent process, and degree of trust participants extended to researchers. Design/Sample:  A descriptive survey was used in this community-based participatory research study with low-income women. Results:  The response rate was 58\% (n=35 of 60 sample). The most compelling reason for enrolling was that the researchers recognized an unmet health need among the population (91\%), followed by the opportunity to talk with other women in similar circumstances (74\%), and the fact that nurses were conducting the study (57\%). Comprehension of informed consent was high, most preferred a ``group'' consent process, and 100\% trusted the researchers to follow procedures outlined in the informed consent document. Conclusion:  Although findings support previous research regarding increased likelihood of enrollment when there is concordance between enrollees' goals and study topic, the establishment of trust between potential enrollees and researchers cannot be underestimated.},

  abstract = {Context: Millions of uninsured Americans ostensibly have insurance available to them\textemdash{}many at very low cost\textemdash{}but do not take it up. Traditional economic analysis is based on the premise that these are rational decisions, but it is hard to reconcile observed enrollment patterns with this view. The policy prescriptions that the traditional model generates may thus fail to achieve their goals. Behavioral economics, which integrates insights from psychology into economic analysis, identifies important deviations from the traditional assumptions of rationality and can thus improve our understanding of what drives health insurance take-up and improved policy design. Methods: Rather than a systematic review of the coverage literature, this article is a primer for considering issues in health insurance coverage from a behavioral economics perspective, supplementing the standard model. We present relevant evidence on decision making and insurance take-up and use it to develop a behavioral approach to both the policy problem posed by the lack of health insurance coverage and possible policy solutions to that problem. Findings: We found that evidence from behavioral economics can shed light on both the sources of low take-up and the efficacy of different policy levers intended to expand coverage. We then applied these insights to policy design questions for public and private insurance coverage and to the implementation of the recently enacted health reform, focusing on the use of behavioral insights to maximize the value of spending on coverage. Conclusions: We concluded that the success of health insurance coverage reform depends crucially on understanding the behavioral barriers to take-up. The take-up process is likely governed by psychology as much as economics, and public resources can likely be used much more effectively with behaviorally informed policy design.},

For people without a safety net of social and financial resources, a shock, such as medical expenses not covered by insurance, can be the first step in a downward spiral toward homelessness and morbidity. Evans et al. evaluate the effectiveness and cost of a program in Chicago that provides temporary financial assistance with the aim of enabling individuals to stay in their homes and out of homeless shelters. They find that one-time payments of up to \$1500 greatly reduce the likelihood of homelessness. The estimated economic benefits exceed the estimated costs, with immeasurable psychic and physical benefits.
Science, this issue p. 694
Despite the prevalence of temporary financial assistance programs for those facing imminent homelessness, there is little evidence of their impact. Using data from Chicago from 2010 to 2012 (n = 4448), we demonstrate that the volatile nature of funding availability leads to good-as-random variation in the allocation of resources to individuals seeking assistance. To estimate impacts, we compare families that call when funds are available with those who call when they are not. We find that those calling when funding is available are 76\% less likely to enter a homeless shelter. The per-person cost of averting homelessness through financial assistance is estimated as \$10,300 and would be much less with better targeting of benefits to lower-income callers. The estimated benefits, not including many health benefits, exceed \$20,000.
Temporary financial assistance can be used successfully to prevent homelessness, is affordable, and helps individuals and families.

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} From birth the child has an ability to respond to the environment, which influences the interaction between mother and child. If this attachment is interrupted, the child's emotional development is negatively influenced. When the child needs care in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) it is difficult to establish contacts between mother and child. Separation from the child is found to be the most difficult aspect for mothers when their newborn child is hospitalized in a NICU. Aim:\hspace{0.6em} The aim of this study was to describe mothers' experiences when their full-term newborn child was cared for in a NICU during the postpartum maternity care period. Method:\hspace{0.6em} A phenomenological hermeneutic interview study was performed. Ten mothers were interviewed once, 6~months to 6~years after the experience. Results:\hspace{0.6em} The essence of the experience is understood as an alternation between two opposite concepts, exclusion and participation, with emphasis on exclusion. A feeling of exclusion dominates when the new mother feels a lack of interaction and a sense of not belonging to either the maternity care unit or the NICU. This has a negative effect on her maternal feelings. On the contrary, when a feeling of participation dominates, a continuous dialogue exists and the mother is cared for as a unique person with unique needs. This supports her maternal feelings in a positive direction. The implication of the result for nurses is that it is important to decrease mothers' experience of exclusion and to increase their feeling of participation when their child is cared for in a NICU. A return visit to the responsible nurse to go through the treatment and experiences should be offered to all parents whose child has been cared for in a NICU.},

The need to further explore what is wrong with postpartum care, in order to stimulate changes and improvements, has been stressed. The principal aim of this study was to describe women's negative experiences of hospital postpartum care, expressed in their own words. Characteristics of the women who spontaneously gave negative comments about postpartum care were compared with those who did not. Data were taken from a population-based prospective longitudinal study of 2783 Swedish-speaking women surveyed at three time points: in early pregnancy, at two months, and at one year postpartum. At the end of the two follow-up questionnaires, women were asked to add any comment they wished. Content analysis of their statements was performed. Altogether 150 women gave negative comments about postpartum care, and this sample was largely representative of the total population-based cohort. The women gave a diverse and detailed description of their experiences, for instance about lack of opportunity to rest and recover, difficulty in getting individualised information and breastfeeding support, and appropriate symptom management. The different statements were summarised in six categories: organisation and environment, staff attitudes and behaviour, breastfeeding support, information, the role of the father and attention to the mother. The findings of this study underline the need to further discuss and specify the aims of postpartum care. The challenge of providing high-quality follow-up after childbirth is discussed in the light of a development characterised by a continuous reduction in the length of hospital stay, in combination with increasing public demands for information and individualised care.},

Design: Longitudinal cohort study.
Setting: Avon.
Participants: Pregnant women resident within Avon with an expected date of delivery between 1 April 1991 and 31 December 1992.
Main outcome measures: Symptom scores from the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale at 18 and 32 weeks of pregnancy and 8 weeks and 8 months postpartum. Proportion of women above a threshold indicating probable depressive disorder.
Results: Depression scores were higher at 32 weeks of pregnancy than 8 weeks postpartum (difference in means 0.88, 95\% confidence interval 0.79 to 0.97). There was no difference in the distribution of total scores or scores for individual items at the four time points. 1222 (13.5\%) women scored above threshold for probable depression at 32 weeks of pregnancy, 821 (9.1\%) at 8 weeks postpartum, and 147 (1.6\%) throughout. More mothers moved above the threshold for depression between 18 weeks and 32 weeks of pregnancy than between 32 weeks of pregnancy and 8 weeks postpartum.
Conclusions: Symptoms of depression are not more common or severe after childbirth than during pregnancy. Research and clinical efforts need to be moved towards understanding, recognising, and treating antenatal depression.},

  volume = {37},
  issn = {0145-2134},
  doi = {10.1016/j.chiabu.2013.03.012},
  abstract = {Objective
As nurse home visiting to prevent child maltreatment grows in popularity with both program administrators and legislators, it is important to understand engagement in such programs in order to improve their community-wide effects. This report examines family demographic and infant health risk factors that predict engagement and follow-through in a universal home-based maltreatment prevention program for new mothers in Durham County, North Carolina.
Methods
Trained staff members attempted to schedule home visits for all new mothers during the birthing hospital stay, and then nurses completed scheduled visits three to five weeks later. Medical record data was used to identify family demographic and infant health risk factors for maltreatment. These variables were used to predict program engagement (scheduling a visit) and follow-through (completing a scheduled visit).
Results
Program staff members were successful in scheduling 78\% of eligible families for a visit and completing 85\% of scheduled visits. Overall, 66\% of eligible families completed at least one visit. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses indicated that high demographic risk and low infant health risk were predictive of scheduling a visit. Both low demographic and infant health risk were predictive of visit completion.
Conclusions
Findings suggest that while higher demographic risk increases families' initial engagement, it might also inhibit their follow-through. Additionally, parents of medically at-risk infants may be particularly difficult to engage in universal home visiting interventions. Implications for recruitment strategies of home visiting programs are discussed.},

  abstract = {A common exercise in empirical studies is a ``robustness check'', where the researcher examines how certain ``core'' regression coefficient estimates behave when the regression specification is modified by adding or removing regressors. If the coefficients are plausible and robust, this is commonly interpreted as evidence of structural validity. Here, we study when and how one can infer structural validity from coefficient robustness and plausibility. As we show, there are numerous pitfalls, as commonly implemented robustness checks give neither necessary nor sufficient evidence for structural validity. Indeed, if not conducted properly, robustness checks can be completely uninformative or entirely misleading. We discuss how critical and non-critical core variables can be properly specified and how non-core variables for the comparison regression can be chosen to ensure that robustness checks are indeed structurally informative. We provide a straightforward new Hausman (1978) type test of robustness for the critical core coefficients, additional diagnostics that can help explain why robustness test rejection occurs, and a new estimator, the Feasible Optimally combined GLS (FOGLeSs) estimator, that makes relatively efficient use of the robustness check regressions. A new procedure for Matlab, testrob, embodies these methods.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although nurse home visiting has proven efficacious with small samples, scaling up to community populations with diverse families has not yet proven effective. The Durham Connects program was developed in collaboration with community leaders as a brief, universal, postnatal nurse home visiting intervention designed to screen for risk, provide brief intervention, and connect families with more intensive evidence-based services as needed. This study tested program effectiveness in reducing infant emergency medical care between birth and age 12 months.
METHODS: All 4777 resident births in Durham, North Carolina across 18 months were randomly assigned, with even birth date families to intervention and odd birth date families to control. Intervention families were offered 3 to 7 contacts between 3 and 12 weeks after birth to assess family needs and connect parents with community resources to improve infant health and well-being. Hospital records were analyzed by using an intent-to-treat design to evaluate impact among a representative subset of 549 families.
RESULTS: After demographic factors (ie, birth risk, Medicaid status, ethnicity, and single parenthood) were covaried, relative to control families, families assigned to intervention had 50\% less total emergency medical care use (mean [M] emergency department visits and hospital overnights) (Mintervention = 0.78 and Mcontrol = 1.57; P $<$ .001, effect size = 0.28) across the first 12 months of life.
CONCLUSIONS: This brief, universal, postnatal nurse home visiting program improves population-level infant health care outcomes for the first 12 months of life. Nurse home visiting can be implemented universally at high fidelity with positive impacts on infant emergency health care that are similar to those of longer, more intensive home visiting programs. This approach offers a novel solution to the paradox of targeting by offering individually tailored intervention while achieving population-level impact.},

  abstract = {What do the half-century decline in U.S. marriage and the attendant rise in single parenthood mean for the economic well-being of children, especially children living in single-parent families? Adam Thomas and Isabel Sawhill show how differing living arrangements can be expected to affect families' economic well-being. Married-parent and cohabiting households, for example, can benefit from economies of scale and from having two adult earners. The availability of child support for single-parent families and the marriage penalties in the tax and transfer system reduce but rarely completely offset the economic benefits of marriage. Consistent with these expectations, national data on family income show that across all races and for a variety of income measures, children in lone-parent families (single-parent households with no cohabiter) have less family income and are more likely to be poor than children in married-parent families. Cohabiting families are generally better off economically than lone-parent families, but considerably worse off than married-parent families. Thomas and Sawhill acknowledge the possibility that the link between famlily structure and family resources may not be causal. But new research that simulates niarriages between existing single mothers and unattached men with similar characteristics suggests that family structure does affect family resources and that child poverty rates would drop substantially if these mothers were to marry. It does not necessarily follow, however, that policymakers ought to, or even can, do anything about family structure. Marriage is not an economic cure-all for the complex problem of child poverty. It would be a mistake for policymakers to focus on promoting marriage to the exclusion of encouraging and rewarding work or addressing problems such as early out-of-wedlock childbearing. Still, Thomas and Sawhill conclude that a continuation of recent declines in single parenthood, linked most recently to declines in teen and out-of-wedlock births, offers great promise for improving the economic welfare of U.S. children.},

It reports 2-year experimental impacts of a universal, integrated school-based intervention in social-emotional learning and literacy development on children's social-emotional, behavioral, and academic functioning. The study employed a school-randomized, experimental design with 1,184 children in 18 elementary schools. Children in the intervention schools showed improvements across several domains: self-reports of hostile attributional bias, aggressive interpersonal negotiation strategies, and depression, and teacher reports of attention skills, and aggressive and socially competent behavior. In addition, there were effects of the intervention on children's math and reading achievement for those identified by teachers at baseline at highest behavioral risk. These findings are interpreted in light of developmental cascades theory and lend support to the value of universal, integrated interventions in the elementary school period for promoting children's social-emotional and academic skills.},

The results show that a firm is considerably more likely to innovate if own-sector employment in its home region is strong. On the other hand, the effect of strong employment in other industries does not appear to be significant. This may indicate that congestion effects outweigh any benefits that may come from diversification within clusters. The limitations of the data, however, do not allow for any definitive conclusion.},

By using the long pre-sample history of innovation information this "entry stock" estimator is shown to control for correlated fixed effects and is compared with an alternative nonlinear GMM estimator. We find evidence of history dependence in innovation activity although variables reflecting the company's economic environment are also found to play a major role.},

A Multivariate Poisson-log normal (MPLN) model and a seemingly unrelated negative binomial (SUNB) model are used to jointly model the observed and contingent behavior data and to correct for on-site sampling.},

Since a variety of other economic data come in the form of repeated counts of some individual actions or events, the methodology should have wide applications. The statistical models we develop are applications and generalizations of Poisson distribution. Two important issues are (i) Given the panel nature of our data, how can we allow for separate persistent individual (fixed or random) effects? (ii) How does one introduce the equivalent of disturbances-in-the-equation into the analysis of Poisson and other discrete probability functions? The first problem is solved by conditioning on the total sum of outcomes over the observed years, while the second problem is solved by introducing an additional source of randomness, allowing the Poisson parameter to be itself randomly distributed, and compounding the two distributions. Lastly, we develop a test statistic for the presence of serial correlation when fixed effects estimators are used in nonlinear conditional models.},

In contrast, output in unregistered or informal manufacturing increased. Regulating in a pro-worker direction was also associated with increases in urban poverty.

There are three kinds of problems that one faces in on-site samples, namely, non-negative integers, truncation and endogenous stratification. Two theoretically correct maximum likelihood methods are developed based on two different assumptions about the variable distribution: the normal distribution and the Poisson distribution. A simulation is performed to compare the two methods using generated data sets of known models. We should not use OLS and instead should use the maximum likelihood methods developed here to estimate demand functions that use on-site samples. If forecasting is the purpose of estimation, then the simulation indicates that the Poisson ML method may be better.},

We~provide conditions under which the model is nonparametrically identified and propose an estimator that can be applied using either repeated cross section or panel data. Our approach provides an estimate of the entire counterfactual distribution of outcomes that would have been experienced by the treatment group in the absence of the treatment and likewise for the untreated group in the presence of the treatment. Thus, it enables the evaluation of policy interventions according to criteria such as a mean\textendash{}variance trade-off.

  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to determine the price sensitivity of smokers in their consumption of cigarettes, using evidence from a major increase in California cigarette prices due to Proposition 10 and the Tobacco Settlement. The study sample consists of individual survey data from Behavioral Risk Factor Survey (BRFS) and price data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics between 1996 and 1999. A zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression model was applied for the statistical analysis. The statistical model showed that price did not have an effect on reducing the estimated prevalence of smoking. However, it indicated that among smokers the price elasticity was at the level of -0.46 and statistically significant. Since smoking prevalence is significantly lower than it was a decade ago, price increases are becoming less effective as an inducement for hard-core smokers to quit, although they may respond by decreasing consumption. For those who only smoke occasionally (many of them being young adults) price increases alone may not be an effective inducement to quit smoking. Additional underlying behavioral factors need to be identified so that more effective anti-smoking strategies can be developed. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {How have recent changes in U.S. family structure affected the cognitive, social, and emotional well-being of the nation's children? Paul Amato examines the effects of family formation on children and evaluates whether current marriage-promotion programs are likely to meet children's needs. Amato begins by investigating how children in households with both biological parents differ from children in households with only one biological parent. He shows that children growing up with two continuously married parents are less likely to experience a wide range of cognitive, emotional, and social problems, not only during childhood but also in adulthood. Although it is not possible to demonstrate that family structure causes these differences, studies using a variety of sophisticated statistical methods suggest that this is the case. Amato then asks what accounts for the differences between these two groups of children. He shows that compared with other children, those who grow up in stable, two-parent families have a higher standard of living, receive more effective parenting, experience more cooperative co-parenting, are emotionally closer to both parents, and are subjected to fewer stressful events and circumstances. Finally, Amato assesses how current marriage-promotion policies will affect the well-being of children. He finds that interventions that increase the share of children who grow up with both parents would improve the overall well-being of U.S. children only modestly, because children's social or emotional problems have many causes, of which family structure is but one. But interventions that lower only modestly the overall share of U.S. children experiencing various problems could nevertheless lower substantially the number of children experiencing them. Even a small decline in percentages, when multiplied by the many children in the population, is a substantial social benefit.},

  abstract = {Although education pays off handsomely in the United States, children from low-income families attain less education than children from more advantaged families. In this article, Cecilia Elena Rouse and Lisa Barrow investigate why family background is so strongly linked to education. The authors show that family socioeconomic status affects such educational outcomes as test scores, grade retention, and high school graduation, and that educational attainment strongly affects adult earnings. They then go on to ask why children from more advantaged families get more or better schooling than those from less advantaged families. For low-income students, greater psychological costs, the cost of forgone income (continuing in school instead of getting a job), and borrowing costs all help to explain why these students attain less education than more privileged children. And these income-related differences in costs may themselves be driven by differences in access to quality schools. As a result, U.S. public schools tend to reinforce the transmission of low socioeconomic status from parents to children. Policy interventions aimed at improving school quality for children from disadvantaged families thus have the potential to increase social mobility. Despite the considerable political attention paid to increasing school accountability, as in the No Child Left Behind Act, along with charter schools and vouchers to help the children of poor families attend private school, to date the best evidence suggests that such programs will improve student achievement only modestly. Based on the best research evidence, smaller class sizes seem to be one promising avenue for improving school quality for disadvantaged students. High teacher quality is also likely to be important. However, advantaged families, by spending more money on education outside school, can and will partly undo policy attempts to equalize school quality for poor and nonpoor children.},

This paper proposes to infer causal impact on the basis of a diffusion-regression state-space model that predicts the counterfactual market response in a synthetic control that would have occurred had no intervention taken place. In contrast to classical difference-in-differences schemes, state-space models make it possible to (i) infer the temporal evolution of attributable impact, (ii) incorporate empirical priors on the parameters in a fully Bayesian treatment, and (iii) flexibly accommodate multiple sources of variation, including local trends, seasonality and the time-varying influence of contemporaneous covariates. Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior inference, we illustrate the statistical properties of our approach on simulated data. We then demonstrate its practical utility by estimating the causal effect of an online advertising campaign on search-related site visits. We discuss the strengths and limitations of state-space models in enabling causal attribution in those settings where a randomised experiment is unavailable. The CausalImpact R package provides an implementation of our approach.},

Method: This study employed a school-randomized, experimental design and included 942 3rd-grade children (49\% boys; 45.6\% Hispanic/Latino, 41.1\% Black/African American, 4.7\% non-Hispanic White, and 8.6\% other racial/ethnic groups, including Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American) in 18 New York City public elementary schools. Data on children's social\textendash{}cognitive processes (e.g., hostile attribution biases), behavioral symptomatology (e.g., conduct problems), and literacy skills and academic achievement (e.g., reading achievement) were collected in the fall and spring of 1 school year. Results: There were main effects of the 4Rs Program after 1 year on only 2 of the 13 outcomes examined. These include children's self-reports of hostile attributional biases (Cohen's d = 0.20) and depression (d = 0.24). As expected based on program and developmental theory, there were impacts of the intervention for those children identified by teachers at baseline with the highest levels of aggression (d = 0.32\textendash{}0.59) on 4 other outcomes: children's self-reports of aggressive fantasies, teacher reports of academic skills, reading achievement scaled scores, and children's attendance. Conclusions: This report of effects of the 4Rs intervention on individual children across domains of functioning after 1 school year represents an important first step in establishing a better understanding of what is achievable by a schoolwide intervention such as the 4Rs in its earliest stages of unfolding. The first-year impacts, combined with our knowledge of sustained and expanded effects after a second year, provide evidence that this intervention may be initiating positive developmental cascades both in the general population of students and among those at highest behavioral risk.},

  abstract = {In panel data models and other regressions with unobserved effects, fixed effects estimation is often paired with cluster-robust variance estimation (CRVE) to account for heteroscedasticity and un-modeled dependence among the errors. Although asymptotically consistent, CRVE can be biased downward when the number of clusters is small, leading to hypothesis tests with rejection rates that are too high. More accurate tests can be constructed using bias-reduced linearization (BRL), which corrects the CRVE based on a working model, in conjunction with a Satterthwaite approximation for t-tests. We propose a generalization of BRL that can be applied in models with arbitrary sets of fixed effects, where the original BRL method is undefined, and describe how to apply the method when the regression is estimated after absorbing the fixed effects. We also propose a small-sample test for multiple-parameter hypotheses, which generalizes the Satterthwaite approximation for t-tests. In simulations covering a wide range of scenarios, we find that the conventional cluster-robust Wald test can severely over-reject while the proposed small-sample test maintains Type I error close to nominal levels. The proposed methods are implemented in an R package called clubSandwich. This article has online supplementary materials.},

We randomly gave cash and in-kind grants to male- and female-owned microenterprises in urban Ghana. For women running subsistence enterprises we find no gain in profits from either treatment. For women with larger businesses we strongly reject equality of the cash and in-kind grants; only in-kind grants cause growth in profits, suggesting a flypaper effect whereby capital coming directly into the business sticks there, but cash does not. The results for men also suggest a lower impact of cash, but differences between cash and in-kind grants are less robust. There is suggestive evidence that the difference in the effects of cash and in-kind grants is associated more with lack of self-control than with external pressure.},

While such a design is suitable for study of highly autocorrelated and relatively precisely measured outcomes in the health and education domains, it is unlikely to be optimal for measuring noisy and relatively less autocorrelated outcomes such as business profits, and household incomes and expenditures. Taking multiple measurements of such outcomes at relatively short intervals allows one to average out noise, increasing power. When the outcomes have low autocorrelation and budget is limited, it can make sense to do no baseline at all. Moreover, I show how for such outcomes, more power can be achieved with multiple follow-ups than allocating the same total sample size over a single follow-up and baseline. I also highlight the large gains in power from ANCOVA analysis rather than difference-in-differences analysis when autocorrelations are low.},

There are often many possibilities, including restricted permutation or permutation of some form of residuals. This paper provides a summary of recent empirical and theoretical results concerning available methods and gives recommendations for their use in univariate and multivariate applications. The focus of the paper is on complex designs in analysis of variance and multiple regression (i.e., linear models). The assumption of exchangeability required for a permutation test is assured by random allocation of treatments to units in experimental work. For observational data, exchangeability is tantamount to the assumption of independent and identically distributed errors under a null hypothesis. For partial regression, the method of permutation of residuals under a reduced model has been shown to provide the best test. For analysis of variance, one must first identify exchangeable units by considering expected mean squares. Then, one may generally produce either (i) an exact test by restricting permutations or (ii) an approximate test by permuting raw data or some form of residuals. The latter can provide a more powerful test in many situations.},

  abstract = {Through this book's unique model comparison approach, students and researchers are introduced to a set of fundamental principles for analyzing data. After seeing how these principles can be applied in simple designs, students are shown how these same principles also apply in more complicated designs. Drs. Maxwell and Delaney believe that the model comparison approach better prepares students to understand the logic behind a general strategy of data analysis appropriate for various designs; and builds a stronger foundation, which allows for the introduction of more complex topics omitted from other books. Several learning tools further strengthen the reader's understanding: \textbullet{}flowcharts assist in choosing the most appropriate technique; \textbullet{}an equation cross-referencing system aids in locating the initial, detailed definition and numerous summary equation tables assist readers in understanding differences between different methods for analyzing their data; \textbullet{}examples based on actual research in a variety of behavioral sciences help students see the applications of the material; \textbullet{}numerous exercises help develop a deeper understanding of the subject. Detailed solutions are provided for some of the exercises and \textbullet{}realistic data sets allow the reader to see an analysis of data from each design in its entirety. Updated throughout, the second edition features: \textbullet{}significantly increased attention to measures of effects, including confidence intervals, strength of association, and effect size estimation for complex and simple designs; \textbullet{}an increased use of statistical packages and the graphical presentation of data; \textbullet{}new chapters (15 \& 16) on multilevel models; \textbullet{}the current controversies regarding statistical reasoning, such as the latest debates on hypothesis testing (ch. 2); \textbullet{}a new preview of the experimental designs covered in the book (ch. 2); \textbullet{}a CD with SPSS and SAS data sets for many of the text exercises, as well as tutorials reviewing basic statistics and regression; and \textbullet{}a Web site containing examples of SPSS and SAS syntax for analyzing many of the text exercises. Appropriate for advanced courses on experimental design or analysis, applied statistics, or analysis of variance taught in departments of psychology, education, statistics, business, and other social sciences, the book is also ideal for practicing researchers in these disciplines. A prerequisite of undergraduate statistics is assumed. An Instructor's Solutions Manual is available to those who adopt the book for classroom use.},

Quite often the data for each patient may be effectively summarized by a pre-treatment mean and a post-treatment mean. Analysis of covariance is the method of choice and its superiority over analysis of post-treatment means or analysis of mean changes is quantified, as regards both reduced variance and avoidance of bias, using a simple model for the covariance structure between time points. Quantitative consideration is also given to practical issues in the design of repeated measures studies: the merits of having more than one pre-treatment measurement are demonstrated, and methods for determining sample sizes in repeated measures designs are provided. Several examples from clinical trials are presented, and broad practical recommendations are made. The examples support the value of the compound symmetry assumption as a realistic simplification in quantitative planning of repeated measures trials. The analysis using summary statistics makes no such assumption. However, allowance in design for alternative non-equal correlation structures can and should be made when necessary.},
