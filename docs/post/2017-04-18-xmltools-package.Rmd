I created a new, small [package called `xmltools`](https://github.com/ultinomics/xmltools) that helps simplify the process of converting XML data into tidy data frames.

It has not yet been tested on a ton of XML files so it may have some bugs. I also have not created any tests. But, at least for me, it helps drastically cut down on the code I have to write to get the data I want from an XML file.

Below is what I wrote as part of the README to the package (it's really more of a vignette.)

```{r readme, child = "/Users/danton/GitHub/xmltools/README.Rmd"}
