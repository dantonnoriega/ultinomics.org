I created a new, small [package called `xmltools`](https://github.com/dantonnoriega/xmltools) that helps simplify the process of converting XML data into tidy data frames.

It has not yet been tested on a ton of XML files so it may have some bugs. I also have not created any tests. But, at least for me, it helps drastically cut down on the code I have to write to get the data I want from an XML file.

Below is what I wrote as part of the README to the package (it's really more of a vignette.)

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
x <- tempfile(fileext = ".Rmd")
on.exit(unlink(x))
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dantonnoriega/xmltools/master/README.Rmd", x)
```

```{r readme, child=normalizePath(x)}
```
